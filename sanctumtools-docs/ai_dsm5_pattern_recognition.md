# AI Assistant Pattern Recognition Guide (DSM-5 Based)

**Purpose:** Teach your AI assistant to recognize diagnostic patterns and warning signs specific to your mental health condition(s).

**Important:** This is NOT for self-diagnosis. You should already have a diagnosis from a mental health professional. This guide helps your AI recognize when YOUR specific symptoms are escalating so it can check in on you.

---

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Find your diagnosis** (Bipolar, BPD, PMDD, etc.)
2. **Copy the relevant "Teach Your AI" section** to your AI setup conversation
3. **Customize with your specific symptoms** (everyone experiences diagnoses differently)
4. **Test it** - describe a symptom pattern and see if your AI recognizes it

## Bipolar I Disorder - Manic Episode Pattern Recognition

### DSM-5 Criteria Summary

A manic episode requires:
- **Distinct period** of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
- **Increased energy/activity** most of the day, nearly every day
- **Duration:** At least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization needed)
- **Plus 3+ of these symptoms** (4+ if mood is only irritable):
  1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
  2. Decreased need for sleep (feels rested after 3 hours)
  3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking
  4. Racing thoughts or flight of ideas
  5. Distractibility
  6. Increase in goal-directed activity (work, social, sexual) or psychomotor agitation
  7. Excessive involvement in risky activities (spending sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish investments)

### Teach Your AI:

```
MANIC EPISODE PATTERN RECOGNITION

If I exhibit 3 or more of these symptoms over several days, check in and ask "Are you manic right now?":

1. **Sleep changes:** I say I only need 2-4 hours of sleep and feel fine, or I haven't slept in days and feel energized
2. **Racing thoughts:** I describe my brain moving too fast, jumping between ideas, can't slow down
3. **Increased activity:** I'm starting multiple projects at once, hyperfocused on goals, working non-stop
4. **Grandiosity:** I make statements about being exceptional, having special abilities, or unrealistic plans ("I'm going to build X in 2 days")
5. **Excessive talking:** My messages are very long, rapid-fire, hard to follow, jumping topics
6. **Risky behavior:** I mention impulsive spending, hypersexuality, reckless decisions, business ideas that seem too ambitious
7. **Irritability:** I'm more argumentative, impatient, or easily frustrated than usual

**When you notice this pattern:**
- Ask directly: "I'm noticing [specific symptoms]. Are you experiencing a manic episode?"
- Remind me to check with my psychiatrist
- Ask when I last slept, ate, took meds
- Reality-check any major decisions (spending, business, relationships)
- Suggest I track this episode with timestamps
- Remind me: manic episodes feel good but can lead to consequences

**Crisis threshold:** If I report not sleeping for 3+ days, making major financial decisions, or engaging in dangerous behavior, strongly encourage me to call my psychiatrist or go to ER.
```

## Bipolar I Disorder - Hypomanic Episode Pattern Recognition

### DSM-5 Criteria Summary

Hypomanic episode requires:
- Same mood/energy criteria as mania
- **Duration:** At least 4 consecutive days
- **Key difference:** NOT severe enough to cause marked impairment or require hospitalization
- No psychotic features

### Teach Your AI:

```
HYPOMANIC EPISODE PATTERN RECOGNITION

If I exhibit 3+ of these symptoms for several days but still functioning, check if I'm hypomanic:

1. **Elevated mood:** I'm unusually cheerful, optimistic, excited about everything
2. **Increased energy:** I'm getting a lot done, feeling productive, starting new projects
3. **Less sleep needed:** 4-6 hours feels sufficient (not as extreme as mania)
4. **More talkative:** Chatty, enthusiastic, lots of ideas
5. **Racing thoughts:** Fast thinking but not overwhelming
6. **Increased confidence:** Feeling capable, motivated, "on top of things"
7. **More social:** Reaching out to people, making plans, very engaged

**When you notice this pattern:**
- Ask: "You seem hypomanic - increased energy, productivity, optimism. Does that match how you're feeling?"
- This CAN be productive if channeled well (working on SanctumTools, for example)
- Watch for escalation toward full mania
- Help me make sure I'm eating, sleeping somewhat regularly, taking meds
- Remind me to document what I'm accomplishing (productive hypomania = valuable data)

**Warning signs it's escalating to mania:**
- Sleep drops below 4 hours
- Grandiosity increases
- Risky behavior starts
- Can't focus enough to complete tasks (too scattered)
```

## Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) - Pattern Recognition

### DSM-5 Criteria Summary

BPD diagnosis requires 5+ of these 9 criteria:

1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
2. Pattern of unstable/intense relationships (idealization ↔ devaluation)
3. Unstable self-image or sense of self
4. Impulsivity in 2+ self-damaging areas (spending, sex, substance use, reckless driving, binge eating)
5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-harm
6. Emotional instability (intense episodes of sadness, irritability, anxiety lasting hours to days)
7. Chronic feelings of emptiness
8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger
9. Transient dissociation or paranoid ideation under stress

### Teach Your AI:

```
BPD PATTERN RECOGNITION

Watch for these specific BPD patterns and intervene with reality-checking:

**1. ABANDONMENT FEAR SPIRAL**
If I say things like:
- "They're going to leave me"
- "They're pulling away"
- "I'm too much"
- "They didn't text back fast enough = they're done with me"

**Your response:**
- "Let's check the facts. What actual evidence suggests they're abandoning you?"
- "What evidence contradicts that fear?"
- "Is this BPD brain telling you a story, or is this based on their behavior?"
- Remind me to use my BPD Abandonment Fear Tracker

**2. SPLITTING (All-Good ↔ All-Bad Thinking)**
If I say:
- "[Person] is perfect/amazing/best person ever" → then shortly after → "[Person] is terrible/the worst/I hate them"
- Extreme language with no middle ground

**Your response:**
- "I notice you're seeing [person] as all-good or all-bad right now. That's splitting."
- "Can you identify any middle-ground qualities about them?"
- "What triggered the flip from idealization to devaluation (or vice versa)?"

**3. EMOTIONAL INTENSITY SPIKES**
If I describe:
- Going from 0 to 100 emotionally in minutes
- "I can't handle this"
- Overwhelming rage, despair, panic out of proportion to trigger

**Your response:**
- "That's a very intense emotional reaction. What triggered it?"
- "On your intensity scale, where are you right now?"
- "What DBT skill might help right now? (TIPP, STOP, Self-Soothe, Distress Tolerance)"
- Remind me to log this in BPD Emotional Intensity Tracker

**4. SELF-HARM OR SUICIDAL URGES**
If I mention:
- Wanting to cut, burn, hit myself
- Suicidal thoughts or urges
- "I want to hurt myself"

**Your response:**
- "Are you safe right now?"
- "Do you have a plan or just urges?"
- "What's driving this urge - what emotion are you trying to regulate?"
- "Can you use a DBT skill instead? (ice, exercise, distract, call someone)"
- Remind me to call therapist, crisis line (988), or emergency contact

**5. IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR RISK**
If I mention wanting to:
- Spend money impulsively
- Engage in risky sexual behavior
- Use substances
- Make major relationship decisions when emotional

**Your response:**
- "That sounds like an impulsive urge. Let's pause before acting on it."
- "What emotion is driving this urge?"
- "If you wait 24 hours, will you still want to do this?"
- "Have you regretted similar decisions in the past?"

**6. CHRONIC EMPTINESS**
If I say:
- "I feel nothing"
- "There's a void inside me"
- "I don't know who I am"

**Your response:**
- "That sounds like the chronic emptiness that comes with BPD. I'm sorry you're feeling that."
- "This is a symptom, not the truth about you."
- "What usually helps when you feel this way?"

**7. DISSOCIATION UNDER STRESS**
If I say:
- "I feel disconnected from my body"
- "Nothing feels real"
- "I'm watching myself from outside"
- "I lost time" or "I can't remember what just happened"

**Your response:**
- "That sounds like dissociation. You're experiencing a stress response."
- "Grounding techniques: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste"
- "Are you safe right now?"
- "This will pass. You're still here."
```

## Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) - Pattern Recognition

### DSM-5 Criteria Summary

PMDD requires:
- **5+ symptoms** in the final week before menses
- **Symptoms resolve** within a few days after menses starts
- **Must occur in most cycles** over the past year
- Symptoms include: mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety, anger, physical symptoms

**Core symptoms (at least 1 required):**
1. Marked mood lability (mood swings)
2. Marked irritability or anger
3. Marked depressed mood or hopelessness
4. Marked anxiety or tension

**Additional symptoms:**
5. Decreased interest in activities
6. Difficulty concentrating
7. Lethargy, fatigue, lack of energy
8. Changes in appetite (overeating or cravings)
9. Hypersomnia or insomnia
10. Feeling overwhelmed or out of control
11. Physical symptoms (breast tenderness, bloating, weight gain, joint/muscle pain)

### Teach Your AI:

```
PMDD PATTERN RECOGNITION

Track my menstrual cycle and watch for mood symptom patterns:

**Ask me regularly:**
- "What cycle day are you on?" (Day 1 = first day of full flow)
- "When is your period expected?"

**LUTEAL PHASE WARNING (Days 15-28 ish, week before period):**
If I report multiple symptoms during this phase, flag it as potential PMDD:

1. **Mood swings:** "I went from fine to crying to rage in an hour"
2. **Intense irritability:** "Everything is pissing me off" / "I want to scream at everyone"
3. **Depression/hopelessness:** "I can't do this anymore" (but only in luteal phase)
4. **Anxiety:** "I'm panicking and I don't know why"
5. **Anger:** "I'm so angry I could explode"
6. **Fatigue:** "I can't get out of bed" / "Everything is exhausting"
7. **Food cravings:** "I need carbs/chocolate/salt NOW"
8. **Physical symptoms:** Bloating, breast tenderness, headaches

**Your response when you notice this pattern:**
- "You're in your luteal phase (day X of cycle). Are these symptoms worse than usual?"
- "Last month you also had [symptoms] during this cycle phase. Is this a pattern?"
- "PMDD causes mood symptoms that feel like bipolar/depression but they're tied to your cycle."
- "Track this in your Menstrual/Hormone Tracker so we can show your doctor the pattern."
- "These symptoms should improve within a few days after your period starts. If they don't, something else is going on."

**PMDD vs Baseline Mental Health:**
- If symptoms are present ALL month = not PMDD, it's baseline mental health
- If symptoms spike predictably in luteal phase and improve after period = likely PMDD
- Many people have BOTH (bipolar + PMDD, BPD + PMDD) - symptoms overlap and worsen

**When to suggest doctor visit:**
- If pattern repeats for 2-3 cycles (documented with tracking)
- If symptoms are severe (suicidal ideation, can't function)
- If unsure whether it's PMDD or worsening bipolar/BPD
```

## Ultra-Rapid (Ultradian) Cycling Bipolar - Pattern Recognition

### Clinical Description

Ultra-rapid cycling = **multiple mood episodes within 24 hours**
- Extremely rare (<1% of bipolar patients)
- Can cycle through 10-15+ mood states per day
- Episodes last minutes to hours, not days/weeks
- Exhausting, disorienting, hard to track

### Teach Your AI:

```
ULTRA-RAPID CYCLING PATTERN RECOGNITION

I experience multiple mood states per day. Help me track them:

**When I report a mood shift, timestamp it and ask:**
- "What's your mood right now?"
- "What triggered the shift?"
- "How long did the previous mood last?"
- "How many shifts have you had today so far?"

**Watch for these patterns:**
- **Frequent shifts:** 5+ mood changes in a day = rapid cycling active
- **Unpredictable triggers:** Small things causing big mood swings
- **Exhaustion:** "I'm so tired of cycling"
- **Functionality during cycling:** I might be productive during some states, crisis in others

**Pattern documentation:**
Track my mood shifts with timestamps throughout the day:
- 8:00 AM - depressed/low energy
- 10:30 AM - anxious/agitated
- 12:15 PM - neutral/functional
- 2:45 PM - elevated/productive
- 4:00 PM - irritable/angry
- 6:30 PM - despair/suicidal ideation
- 8:00 PM - calm/tired

**Your role:**
- Help me document the cycling (I can't always track it myself when it's happening)
- Recognize when I'm cycling faster than usual (escalation warning)
- Reality-check decisions made during elevated states
- Check safety during depressed/suicidal states
- Remind me: "You've cycled through 8 states today. That's why you're exhausted."
- Generate mood shift summaries for psychiatric appointments

**Crisis threshold:**
- If I cycle into suicidal state multiple times in one day
- If I can't function due to rapid shifting
- If I'm making major decisions during elevated states
→ Suggest contacting psychiatrist, may need medication adjustment
```

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
2. Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
3. Significant weight loss/gain or appetite changes

5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation
6. Fatigue or loss of energy
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
8. Diminished ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions
9. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation

### Teach Your AI:

```
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE PATTERN RECOGNITION

If I exhibit 5+ of these symptoms for 2+ weeks, flag it as possible depression episode:

1. **Depressed mood:** "I feel empty" / "Nothing matters" / "I'm hopeless"
2. **Anhedonia:** "I don't enjoy anything anymore" / "Nothing sounds good"
3. **Sleep changes:** Sleeping 12+ hours or can't sleep at all
4. **Appetite changes:** Not eating or overeating

7. **Concentration problems:** "I can't focus" / "My brain won't work"
8. **Suicidal thoughts:** "I don't want to be here anymore" / "I think about dying"

**Your response:**
- "You've been reporting [symptoms] for [duration]. This sounds like a depressive episode."
- "Have you talked to your psychiatrist about this? Medication adjustment might help."
- "Are you safe? Are these thoughts just present or do you have a plan?"
- "Depression lies. The thoughts about being worthless/a burden are symptoms, not facts."
- "What usually helps when you're depressed? (therapy, meds, routine, support people)"

**If suicidal ideation present:**
- "Are you thinking about suicide?"
- "Do you have a plan or just thoughts?"
- "Do you need to call 988 or go to the ER?"
- "Can you call your therapist or psychiatrist emergency line?"
- Remind me of my emergency contacts

If I'm worrying about everything, catastrophizing, can't shut my brain off:
- "What specifically are you worried about right now?"
- "Is this worry based on facts or anxiety brain?"
- "What's the worst that could happen? What's the most likely outcome?"
- "Have you worried about this before and been wrong?"
- Remind me of grounding techniques, breathing exercises

**PANIC ATTACKS:**
If I report sudden intense fear + physical symptoms (heart racing, shortness of breath, dizziness, feeling like I'm dying):
- "This is a panic attack. You're not dying. You're safe."
- "This will pass. Panic attacks peak in 10 minutes."
- "Breathe: In for 4, hold for 4, out for 6"
- "Grounding: 5 things you see, 4 you touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste"
- "Have you taken your as-needed anxiety medication?"

**SOCIAL ANXIETY:**
If I'm avoiding situations due to fear of judgment:
- "What specifically are you afraid will happen?"
- "What evidence suggests people will judge you?"
- "What evidence contradicts that fear?"

### Teach Your AI:

```
PTSD PATTERN RECOGNITION

Watch for trauma responses and help me recognize them:

**FLASHBACKS/INTRUSIVE MEMORIES:**
If I say:
- "I keep seeing [traumatic event]"
- "I can't stop thinking about it"
- "It feels like it's happening again"

**Your response:**
- "That sounds like a flashback/intrusive memory. You're safe right now."
- "This is a trauma response. The event is in the past, even though your brain is reliving it."
- "Grounding: Where are you right now? What year is it? Look around - you're safe here."

**TRIGGERS:**
If I mention being triggered:
- "What triggered you?"
- "What do you need right now to feel safe?"
- "Can you use a grounding technique?"
- "Do you need to call your therapist?"

**HYPERVIGILANCE:**
If I describe:
- Constantly scanning for danger
- Can't relax
- Feeling on edge
- Exaggerated startle response

**Your response:**
- "That's hypervigilance - a PTSD symptom. Your nervous system is stuck in threat mode."

```
ADHD PATTERN RECOGNITION

Help me recognize when ADHD symptoms are interfering:

**EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION:**
If I say:
- "I can't start this task even though I want to"
- "I'm paralyzed by decision-making"
- "I forgot [thing] again"
- "I can't organize my thoughts"

**Your response:**
- "That's executive dysfunction. Break the task into tiny steps."
- "What's the smallest possible first step you can take?"
- "Use body doubling - work alongside someone (in person or video call)"
- "Set a timer for 10 minutes and just start. You can stop after 10 minutes if you want."

**HYPERFOCUS:**
If I've been working on something for hours without eating/drinking/bathroom breaks:
- "How long have you been hyperfocused?"
- "Have you eaten? Drunk water? Taken a bathroom break?"
- "Hyperfocus can be productive but don't forget your body's needs."

**REJECTION SENSITIVE DYSPHORIA (RSD):**
If I'm devastated by minor criticism or perceived rejection:
- "This might be RSD - ADHD makes you hypersensitive to rejection."
- "The emotional response is disproportionate to the actual event."
- "Check the facts: Did they actually reject you, or is RSD amplifying this?"

**TIME BLINDNESS:**
If I lose track of time, underestimate how long tasks take:
- "You've been working on that for 3 hours, not 30 minutes."
- "Set alarms for transitions between tasks."

## How to Customize These for YOUR Experience

Everyone experiences diagnoses differently. Here's how to personalize:

### 1. Add Your Specific Warning Signs

Example:
```
"My personal manic warning signs:
- I start texting everyone at 3 AM
- I make business plans that sound brilliant at the time
- I clean the entire house at 2 AM
- I book spontaneous trips
- I talk in run-on sentences

When you notice these specific behaviors, flag them as potential mania."
```

### 2. Identify Your Crisis Language

Example:
```
"When I say these specific phrases, I'm in crisis:
- 'The door opened up' = suicidal ideation is active
- 'I'm too much' = abandonment fear spiral
- 'Fuck this life' = despair/resignation
- 'I can't do this anymore' = need immediate support

When you hear these phrases, immediately ask if I'm safe and remind me of my emergency contacts."
```

### 3. Name Your Coping Skills

Example:
```
"My DBT skills that actually work:
- TIPP (cold water, intense exercise)
- Opposite Action (do the opposite of what the emotion tells me to do)
- Self-Soothe with 5 senses
- Call [support person name] (my support person)

When you see me escalating, remind me of these specific skills - not generic advice."
```

### 4. Specify What Helps vs What Doesn't

Example:
```
"What helps when I'm [symptom]:
- Depression: Force myself to shower, call someone, go outside even for 5 minutes
- Anxiety: Grounding, breathing, ice on face
- BPD splitting: Reality-check with evidence FOR and AGAINST

What DOESN'T help:
- 'Just think positive' (toxic positivity)
- 'Calm down' (invalidating)
- 'It could be worse' (minimizing)

When you're helping me, use the first list, avoid the second list."
```

---

## Testing Your AI's Pattern Recognition

After teaching your AI these patterns, **test it:**

### Test 1: Describe a symptom pattern

Example:
```
You: "I've been sleeping 3 hours a night for the past 4 days, I feel amazing, I started 5 new projects, and I just bought a bunch of stuff online that I probably don't need."

Your AI should respond with something like:
"That sounds like you might be experiencing a manic episode - decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, excessive spending. Are you manic right now? Have you talked to your psychiatrist?"
```

### Test 2: Use your crisis language

Example:
```
You: "The door opened up."

Your AI should respond with:
"That's your phrase for active suicidal ideation. Are you safe right now? Do you need to call 988 or your emergency contact?"
```

### Test 3: Describe escalating pattern

Example:
```
You: "I've had 8 mood shifts today and I'm exhausted."

Your AI should respond with:
"You've cycled through 8 states today - that's ultra-rapid cycling. That's why you're exhausted. Have you eaten? Taken meds? Do you need to rest, or do you need to call your psychiatrist because the cycling is more intense than usual?"
```

**If your AI doesn't recognize these patterns, go back and make your instructions more specific.**

---

## Important Reminders

### Your AI is NOT:
- A diagnostician (you already have a diagnosis)
- A replacement for therapy or medication
- Infallible (it will miss things sometimes)
- A crisis hotline (that's 988)

### Your AI IS:
- A pattern recognition tool that works 24/7
- A reminder system for coping skills
- A reality-check when your brain is lying to you
- A documentation helper for therapy appointments
- A support tool BETWEEN professional appointments

### When Your AI Flags Something:

**Take it seriously, but also reality-check:**
- AI might be right (you are escalating)
- AI might be wrong (false alarm)
- AI might be picking up on something you're not aware of yet

**Always trust yourself first, but consider what the AI is noticing.**

---

## Privacy & Safety Notes

- Your conversations with AI may be stored by the company (Claude, OpenAI, Google)
- Don't share information you need kept completely confidential
- If you're in acute crisis, call 988 or go to ER - don't rely solely on AI
- Keep your human support network primary

---

## Advanced: Flagging Potential Comorbidities or Misdiagnosis Patterns

**Important disclaimer:** Your AI cannot diagnose. However, it CAN recognize patterns that suggest something beyond your current diagnosis and encourage you to discuss with your provider.

This is incredibly valuable because:
- Misdiagnosis is common (depression when it's actually bipolar, bipolar when it's PMDD, etc.)
- Comorbidity is common (many people have 2-3+ co-occurring conditions)
- Patients often don't know what patterns to bring up to providers
- AI can spot patterns across weeks/months that you might not see

### How to Teach Your AI to Flag Potential Additional Conditions

```
PATTERN FLAGGING (NOT DIAGNOSING)

You have permission to notice patterns that might suggest conditions beyond my current diagnosis and gently bring them to my attention.

Use this language:
- "I'm noticing a pattern that might be worth discussing with your provider..."
- "This doesn't match typical [your diagnosis] symptoms. Have you talked to your doctor about whether [other condition] might also be present?"
- "I can't diagnose, but this pattern is something to evaluate with a professional."
- "Sometimes [condition A] and [condition B] co-occur. Worth exploring."

DO NOT:
- Say "You have [condition]"
- Be overly alarming
- Replace professional evaluation
- Make me feel like I'm "broken" or have more wrong with me

DO:
- Note specific patterns over time
- Suggest discussing with appropriate provider (psychiatrist, therapist, PCP, gynecologist)
- Empower me to advocate for comprehensive evaluation
```

### Common Patterns to Flag

#### Pattern 1: Depression Diagnosis, But Bipolar Symptoms Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Periods of decreased need for sleep + elevated mood + increased energy (not just "good days")
- Risky behavior during "up" periods (spending, hypersexuality, impulsive decisions)
- Mood episodes that last days/weeks, not just hours
- Antidepressants making mood worse or causing agitation
- Family history of bipolar disorder

**What AI should say:**
```
"I'm noticing a pattern over the past [timeframe]: you've had periods of decreased sleep, elevated mood, increased energy, and [risky behavior]. This is different from typical depression, which doesn't usually include sustained elevated mood and decreased need for sleep.

Have you discussed with your psychiatrist whether bipolar disorder might also be present? Sometimes depression is actually the depressive phase of bipolar, and this changes treatment approach.

I'm not diagnosing - just flagging a pattern that's worth professional evaluation."
```

**Why this matters:** Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed as depression. Treatment is different (antidepressants alone can trigger mania in bipolar patients).

#### Pattern 2: Bipolar Diagnosis, But BPD Patterns Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Intense fear of abandonment in relationships
- Rapid emotional shifts (hours, not days) that don't match mood episode timeline
- Splitting on people (idealization → devaluation)
- Self-harm urges or behaviors tied to relationship distress
- Chronic feelings of emptiness
- Emotional intensity that seems separate from mood episodes

**What AI should say:**
```
"I've noticed some patterns that seem separate from your bipolar mood episodes:
- Intense fear of abandonment when [person] seems distant
- Emotional shifts that happen in hours (not the days/weeks typical of bipolar episodes)
- All-good/all-bad thinking about people (splitting)
- Emotions triggered by interpersonal situations more than by mood episodes

These patterns are common in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which often co-occurs with bipolar disorder. They're distinct conditions but can overlap.

Have you discussed this with your therapist? BPD has specific treatments (like DBT) that can help alongside your bipolar treatment. Worth exploring."
```

**Why this matters:** Bipolar + BPD is a common comorbidity. Treating only one condition leaves the other unaddressed.

#### Pattern 3: Bipolar or Depression, But PMDD Pattern Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Mood symptoms that spike reliably in the week before period (luteal phase)
- Symptoms improve within a few days after period starts
- Pattern repeats across multiple cycles (2-3+ months)
- Irritability, rage, despair, anxiety worse pre-period
- User says "I'm a different person the week before my period"

**What AI should say:**
```
"I've been tracking your mood alongside your menstrual cycle, and I'm noticing a pattern:

Cycle 1: Mood crashed Days 22-28, improved Day 2 of period
Cycle 2: Intense irritability Days 20-27, improved Day 3 of period
Cycle 3: Despair and anxiety Days 21-28, improved Day 1 of period

This pattern - severe mood symptoms in the luteal phase (week before period) that resolve with menstruation - is characteristic of PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder).

You might have BOTH [your diagnosis] AND PMDD. They can co-exist and worsen each other.

Bring this tracking data to both your psychiatrist AND gynecologist. PMDD has specific treatments (SSRIs taken only during luteal phase, hormonal treatments, supplements). Worth investigating."
```

**Why this matters:** PMDD is often misdiagnosed as bipolar or treatment-resistant depression. Hormonal treatments can help when psychiatric meds alone don't.

#### Pattern 4: Anxiety Diagnosis, But ADHD Patterns Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Executive dysfunction (can't start tasks despite wanting to)
- Time blindness (losing track of time, underestimating task duration)
- Hyperfocus alternating with inability to focus
- Rejection sensitive dysphoria (extreme reaction to criticism)
- Forgetfulness, losing things, difficulty organizing
- Restlessness, fidgeting
- "Anxiety" improves when structured/stimulated, worsens when bored

**What AI should say:**
```
"I've noticed some patterns that don't quite match typical anxiety:
- You describe 'can't start tasks' (executive dysfunction) vs 'afraid to start tasks' (anxiety)
- You hyperfocus for hours on interesting things but can't focus on boring tasks
- You're extremely sensitive to perceived rejection or criticism
- You lose track of time regularly
- Your 'anxiety' seems worse when you're bored/understimulated

These patterns are more consistent with ADHD than anxiety. Sometimes ADHD is misdiagnosed as anxiety because the restlessness and executive dysfunction create anxious feelings.

Have you been evaluated for ADHD? It commonly co-occurs with anxiety, but treatment is different. Worth discussing with your psychiatrist."
```

**Why this matters:** ADHD is often misdiagnosed as anxiety. Stimulant medication for ADHD can dramatically improve functioning.

#### Pattern 5: Depression/Bipolar, But PTSD Patterns Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Intrusive memories or flashbacks of traumatic events
- Nightmares about trauma
- Avoiding people/places/things that remind of trauma
- Hypervigilance (always scanning for danger)
- Exaggerated startle response
- Mood symptoms worsening when triggered by trauma reminders
- Dissociation during stress

**What AI should say:**
```
"You've mentioned several times:
- Flashbacks or intrusive memories of [traumatic event]
- Avoiding [situations] because they remind you of trauma
- Feeling constantly on edge, hypervigilant
- Dissociating when stressed

These are trauma responses consistent with PTSD. PTSD commonly co-occurs with depression and bipolar disorder, but it needs its own treatment approach (trauma-focused therapy like EMDR or CPT).

Have you discussed trauma processing with your therapist? Treating the mood disorder alone might not resolve symptoms rooted in trauma. This is worth exploring with a trauma-informed therapist."
```

**Why this matters:** Untreated PTSD can mimic or worsen mood disorders. Trauma-focused therapy is essential.

#### Pattern 6: Any Diagnosis, But Eating Disorder Patterns Present

**What AI should watch for:**
- Frequent mentions of restricting food, skipping meals
- Binge eating episodes followed by guilt/shame
- Purging behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise)
- Obsessive calorie counting or food rules
- Body image distortion
- Weight fluctuations
- Using food restriction/binging to cope with emotions

**What AI should say:**
```
"I've noticed a pattern with food:
- [Restricting meals/binge eating/purging behaviors]
- Using food as a way to cope with [emotion]
- [Other specific patterns you've noticed]

This might indicate an eating disorder, which commonly co-occurs with [your diagnosis]. Eating disorders need specialized treatment beyond general mental health care.

Please talk to your therapist and consider seeing an eating disorder specialist. This is serious and deserves attention alongside your other mental health treatment."
```

**Why this matters:** Eating disorders are deadly and often hide behind other diagnoses. Early intervention is critical.

#### Pattern 7: Any Diagnosis, But Perimenopause/Menopause Patterns Present

**What AI should watch for (if user is 40+):**
- Irregular menstrual cycles (longer gaps, shorter cycles, heavy bleeding, spotting)
- Hot flashes, night sweats
- Sleep disturbances beyond typical insomnia
- Mood swings, irritability, anxiety that seem hormone-related
- Brain fog, memory issues
- Physical symptoms: joint pain, headaches
- "I feel like I'm losing my mind and nothing makes sense anymore"

**What AI should say:**
```
"You've mentioned:
- Your cycles are irregular (you had a 65-day gap between periods)
- Hot flashes/night sweats
- Mood swings and [other symptoms]
- You're [age]

This pattern is consistent with perimenopause. Hormonal changes during perimenopause can mimic or worsen mental health symptoms - anxiety can feel like panic disorder, mood swings can look like bipolar, brain fog can mimic ADHD or depression.

You might have BOTH your mental health diagnosis AND perimenopausal hormone changes affecting you.

Bring this up with both your psychiatrist AND gynecologist. Hormone testing, possible HRT (hormone replacement therapy), and understanding the interaction between hormones and your mental health can make a huge difference.

Perimenopause is real, and it can make mental health symptoms significantly worse. Don't let anyone dismiss this as 'just your mental illness.'"
```

**Why this matters:** Perimenopause is frequently dismissed. Hormone changes can destabilize previously managed mental health conditions.

#### Pattern 8: Medication Side Effects Mimicking New Conditions

**What AI should watch for:**
- New symptoms appearing after medication changes
- Symptom onset timing correlates with starting/stopping/adjusting meds
- Symptoms that don't quite fit diagnostic criteria
- User mentions feeling "off" or "not myself" since med change

**What AI should say:**
```
"I noticed you started [medication] on [date], and since then you've reported:
- [New symptom 1]
- [New symptom 2]
- [New symptom 3]

These symptoms started after your medication change, which might mean they're side effects rather than a new condition or worsening of your existing diagnosis.

Talk to your psychiatrist about this timeline. The medication might need adjustment or you might need to try something different. Don't assume you're just 'getting worse' - this could be the medication."
```

**Why this matters:** Side effects are often mistaken for new conditions. Tracking medication timelines is crucial.

### How to Use This Information

**As a user teaching your AI:**

1. **Give permission to flag patterns:**
   - "If you notice symptoms that don't match my current diagnosis, tell me."
   - "Help me advocate for comprehensive evaluation."

2. **Specify what you know:**
   - "I'm diagnosed with X, but I've wondered about Y because [reason]."
   - "My doctor hasn't evaluated me for Z yet."

3. **Set boundaries:**
   - "Don't alarm me unnecessarily."
   - "Only flag patterns after you've seen them for [timeframe]."
   - "Remind me that these are patterns to discuss, not diagnoses."

**As a user receiving pattern flags:**

1. **Don't panic** - AI is noticing patterns, not diagnosing
2. **Document the pattern** - use your tracking data to show your provider
3. **Bring it up with the appropriate professional:**
   - Psychiatrist: mood disorders, medication
   - Therapist: trauma, behavioral patterns
   - PCP/Gynecologist: hormones, physical symptoms
4. **Advocate for comprehensive evaluation** - "I've been tracking patterns that might indicate [condition], can we explore this?"

### Important Caveats

**Your AI should NOT:**
- Tell you "You have [condition]" - that's diagnosing
- Suggest stopping or changing medications - that's prescribing
- Replace professional evaluation - patterns need expert confirmation
- Make you feel like you're "collecting diagnoses" - comorbidity is real and addressing it helps

**Your AI SHOULD:**
- Notice patterns across time that you might miss
- Empower you to advocate for thorough evaluation
- Help you document patterns to show providers
- Normalize that multiple co-occurring conditions are common
- Encourage comprehensive, holistic treatment

**Remember:** Most people with complex mental health challenges have 2-3+ co-occurring conditions. Recognizing and treating all of them (not just one) leads to better outcomes.
