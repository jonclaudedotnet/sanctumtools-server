## Why Track Abandonment Fears?

Fear of abandonment is a core feature of BPD. It can be triggered by:
- Real or imagined rejection
- Changes in relationship dynamics
- Someone being less available than usual
- Conflict or criticism
- Your own perception that you're "too much"

**This tracker helps you:**
- Separate fear from facts
- Identify false alarms vs real concerns
- Track patterns in what triggers the fear
- Monitor effectiveness of coping strategies
- Build evidence that you can survive the fear without acting on it

## Reality Check Questions (Use When Fear Strikes)

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Have they given me actual evidence they're leaving?**
   - Not texting back fast ≠ leaving
   - Being busy ≠ leaving
   - Having their own life ≠ leaving

2. **Is this person's pattern consistent with abandonment?**
   - Have they left before in similar situations?
   - Or have they stayed through worse?

3. **Am I mind-reading?**
   - Do I actually know what they're thinking?
   - Or am I assuming based on fear?

4. **What would I tell a friend in this situation?**
   - If your friend felt this fear, what would you say?

5. **Has this fear been wrong before?**
   - How many times have I felt certain someone was leaving, and they didn't?

6. **Even if they do leave, can I survive it?**
   - Have I survived relationship losses before?
   - Am I more resilient than I think?

## Important Reminders

**Fear of abandonment is a symptom, not a fact.**

Just because you feel it intensely doesn't mean it's happening.

**People can love you AND need space.**

Needing time alone ≠ rejecting you.

**Your fear is real. The abandonment might not be.**

Validate the feeling without acting on the fear.

**You've survived every abandonment fear so far.**

Even when people did leave, you're still here.

**Acting on fear often creates the outcome you fear.**

Excessive texting, testing, pushing away = exactly what pushes people away.

**You are not too much. You are learning to manage a very real symptom.**

**This work is hard. You're doing it anyway. That's courage.**
