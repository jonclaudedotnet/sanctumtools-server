# BPD Emotional Intensity Tracker

**Purpose:** Track rapid emotional shifts, intensity levels, triggers, and DBT skill effectiveness for Borderline Personality Disorder.

**Patient:** {{CLIENT_NAME}}

---

## How to Use This

BPD emotions can go from 0→10→0 in minutes. This tracker captures:
- What emotion you're feeling
- How intense it is (0-10 scale)
- What triggered it (especially interpersonal triggers)
- What urges came with it
- What DBT skill you tried
- Whether it worked

**Log in real-time when emotions spike.** Even if you can only write "8/10 rage, triggered by text" - that's enough.

## Weekly Pattern Review

**After 7 days, look for:**
- Most common triggers (person? situation? time of day?)
- Which emotions are most intense/frequent
- Which DBT skills work best for you
- Which urges are hardest to resist
- Patterns in interpersonal conflicts

**Share this data with your DBT therapist.**

## Notes

- **Your intensity scale: {{INTENSITY_SCALE}}**
  - Use whatever feels most accurate to describe how intense the emotion is
  - No right or wrong way to rate it
  - Consistency matters more than perfection

- **"My interpretation" vs reality:** BPD often involves cognitive distortions about relationships. Tracking your interpretation separately helps identify patterns where your brain lies to you.

- **Urges vs actions:** Having an urge is NOT the same as acting on it. Track both to see progress.

- **Skills not working:** Sometimes skills don't work, especially at high intensity. That's data, not failure. Note it and discuss with therapist.

**This tracker is for YOU and your treatment team. No judgment, just data.**
