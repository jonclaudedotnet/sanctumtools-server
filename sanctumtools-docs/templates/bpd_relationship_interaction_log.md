## Cognitive Distortions Common in BPD

Watch for these in your interpretations:

**Mind Reading:** Assuming you know what someone is thinking
- "They think I'm annoying"
- "They secretly hate me"

**Catastrophizing:** Jumping to worst-case scenario
- "They didn't text back = they're leaving me forever"

**Black-and-White Thinking:** All good or all bad, no middle ground
- "They criticized me once = they hate everything about me"

**Fortune Telling:** Predicting the future negatively
- "This relationship will fail like all the others"

**Personalization:** Making everything about you
- "They had a bad day = I did something wrong"

**Emotional Reasoning:** Feelings = facts
- "I feel abandoned = I am being abandoned"

---

## Notes

- **This is hard work.** Tracking your distortions is uncomfortable. That discomfort is part of getting better.

- **Patterns take time to see.** One week might not be enough. Keep tracking.

- **Share with trusted people.** If you're comfortable, show this log to the person you're splitting on. "I know my brain is lying to me sometimes. Can you help me reality-check?"

- **Progress isn't linear.** Some days you'll catch every distortion. Other days you won't. Both are data.

**You're doing the work. That's what matters.**
