# Menstrual & Hormone Tracker

**Purpose:** Track menstrual cycles and hormone-related symptoms alongside mental health patterns to identify correlations.

**Patient:** {{CLIENT_NAME}}

---

## Why Track Your Cycle?

**Mental health is affected by hormones:**
- PMDD causes severe mood shifts tied to cycle
- Bipolar episodes can be triggered by hormonal changes
- BPD symptoms often worsen pre-period
- Perimenopause can mimic or worsen mental health symptoms
- Medications work differently at different cycle points

**This tracker helps you:**
- Identify if mood crashes happen at specific cycle days
- Distinguish hormone-related symptoms from baseline mental health
- Predict when you're more vulnerable to crisis
- Provide data to both psychiatrist AND gynecologist
- Adjust treatment based on cycle patterns

## Multi-Cycle Pattern Analysis

**After tracking 3+ cycles, look for:**

### Mood Patterns

**Do you experience mood crashes at:**
- [ ] Days 1-3 (during period)
- [ ] Days 4-7 (end of period/follicular)
- [ ] Days 12-16 (ovulation - estrogen peak)
- [ ] Days 20-28 (luteal phase - progesterone drop)
- [ ] No predictable pattern
- [ ] Varies every cycle

**PMDD screening:**
If you have severe mood symptoms (rage, despair, anxiety, suicidal thoughts) in the week before your period that improve within days of period starting, this could be PMDD. Track for 2-3 cycles and discuss with doctor.

**Perimenopause patterns:**
If cycles are irregular (varying by 7+ days) and you're experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and sleep issues - this may be perimenopause. Hormone testing + psychiatry consult recommended.

### Physical Symptom Patterns

**Symptoms that reliably show up every cycle:**
```
```

**Symptoms that are getting worse over time:**
```
```

**Symptoms that are new/unusual:**
```
```

---

### Medication Effectiveness Patterns

**Do your psych meds seem less effective at certain cycle points?**
```
[Example: "Lurasidone doesn't work as well Days 22-28 every cycle"]
```

**Do you need higher doses or additional support at certain times?**
```
```

**Have you noticed breakthrough symptoms at predictable cycle points despite meds?**
```
```

## For Healthcare Providers

**Bring this tracker to:**

**Psychiatrist:**
- Show correlation between cycle and mood episodes
- Discuss medication adjustments for specific cycle phases
- Consider adding PMDD-specific treatment if indicated

**Gynecologist/PCP:**
- Discuss perimenopause symptoms
- Evaluate need for hormone testing
- Consider HRT if perimenopause is severe
- Rule out other hormonal conditions (thyroid, PCOS, etc.)

**Therapist:**
- Identify vulnerable times for increased support
- Plan coping strategies for predictable mood dips
- Validate that hormone-related symptoms are REAL

## Important Notes

**Perimenopause can mimic or worsen mental illness:**
- Mood swings that feel like rapid cycling
- Anxiety that feels like panic disorder
- Sleep issues that worsen bipolar symptoms
- Brain fog that mimics ADHD or depression

**Both things can be true at once:**
You can have bipolar disorder AND PMDD.
You can be perimenopausal AND have worsening BPD symptoms.
It's not either/or - it's often both.

**Tracking helps separate:**
- Baseline mental health symptoms (present all month)
- Hormone-related symptoms (present only at specific cycle points)
- Overlapping symptoms (hormones making baseline worse)
