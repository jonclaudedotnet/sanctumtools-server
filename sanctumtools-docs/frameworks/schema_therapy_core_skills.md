# Core Schema Therapy Skills for [AI] to Learn

**Purpose:** CBT skills for conversational mood tracking
**Purpose:** Multi-modal therapeutic approach for SanctumTools - Schema Therapy component (deep patterns, modes, reparenting)
**Sources validated:** Jeffrey Young (founder), 2024 research on BPD treatment, clinical evidence base
**Testing period:** during testing with [USER] (dogfooding)
**Primary application:** Deep-rooted patterns, Punitive Parent mode, Vulnerable Child, self-criticism, abandonment fears, BPD symptoms

---

## Overview

**Schema Therapy** was developed by Jeffrey Young in the 1990s as an integrative approach that extends traditional CBT to address deeper, more entrenched psychological patterns - particularly for personality disorders and chronic conditions that don't respond to standard CBT.

**What makes Schema Therapy different:**
- **CBT** changes thoughts to change feelings (surface level, present-focused)
- **DBT** teaches skills to regulate emotions (crisis management, present-focused)
- **MBT** improves mentalizing about mental states (relationships, present-focused)
- **Schema Therapy** heals early emotional wounds through experiential reparenting (deep patterns, past + present)

**Why Schema Therapy matters for BPD:**
- BPD patients have a **powerful Punitive Parent mode** (internalized abuse/criticism)
- Vulnerable Child mode is stuck in abandonment terror
- Coping modes (Detached Protector, Compliant Surrenderer) block healing
- Needs **emotional reparenting**, not just cognitive change or skills training

**2024 Evidence:**
- Randomized trial comparing Schema Therapy to DBT for BPD showed both equally effective
- Schema Therapy with comorbid conditions (alcohol use disorder) shows sustained improvement at 1-year follow-up
- Patients report improved self-understanding and emotional awareness
- Evidence-based treatment recognized by APA

## The Schema Therapy Framework: Schemas vs. Modes

### Early Maladaptive Schemas

**Definition:** Deep, pervasive patterns formed in childhood when core needs aren't met. These are the **underlying beliefs** about self, others, and the world.

**The 18 Schemas (documented in `schema_therapy_18_schemas_definitions.txt`):**

Organized into 5 domains:

**1. Disconnection & Rejection Domain:**
- Emotional Deprivation
- Abandonment
- Mistrust/Abuse
- Social Isolation
- Defectiveness/Shame

**2. Impaired Autonomy Domain:**
- Incompetence/Dependence
- Vulnerability to Harm
- Enmeshment
- Failure

**3. Impaired Limits Domain:**
- Entitlement/Superiority
- Insufficient Self-Control

**4. Other-Directedness Domain:**
- Subjugation
- Self-Sacrifice
- Approval-Seeking

**5. Overvigilance & Inhibition Domain:**
- Emotional Inhibition
- Unrelenting Standards
- Pessimism/Worry
- Self-Punitiveness

**Note:** Schemas are the **core beliefs**. But Schema Therapy focuses more on **modes** - the moment-to-moment emotional states that activate when schemas are triggered.

---

### Schema Modes (The Key Innovation)

**Definition:** Modes are the **emotional states** we shift into when schemas are activated. They represent different parts of the self operating at any given moment.

**The Four Main Categories:**

1. **Child Modes** - The emotional, vulnerable parts
2. **Parent Modes** - Internalized critical/demanding voices
3. **Coping Modes** - Dysfunctional ways of managing distress
4. **Healthy Adult Mode** - The integrated, functional self (the goal)

**Why modes matter:**
- Schemas are stable traits; modes are **state-dependent**
- You can shift between modes rapidly
- Treatment targets **modes in action**, not abstract schemas
- Easier to recognize "I'm in Punitive Parent mode right now" than "My Self-Punitiveness schema is active"

---

## The Schema Modes: Complete Framework

### Category 1: Child Modes

Child modes hold **core emotions** - the feelings we experienced when our needs weren't met as children.

#### Vulnerable Child Mode ⭐ (Central to therapy)

**What it is:** The part that feels lonely, abandoned, abused, frightened, overwhelmed, defective, worthless, unloved, incompetent, helpless, directionless, fragile, defeated.

**When it activates:**
- Abandonment triggers
- Criticism or rejection
- Feeling unsupported or misunderstood
- Overwhelming situations
- When core needs aren't met

**What it feels like:**
- Small, scared, powerless
- Desperate for connection
- Convinced of being unlovable
- "I'm all alone and no one cares"

**BPD pattern:** Vulnerable Child is **chronically activated** in BPD, especially around attachment figures. The terror of abandonment lives here.

**Treatment goal:** Reparent the Vulnerable Child - provide the nurturing, protection, and validation that wasn't there in childhood.

---

#### Angry Child Mode

**What it is:** Feels intensely angry, enraged, frustrated, or impatient because core needs are not being met.

**When it activates:**
- Feeling controlled or trapped
- Boundaries violated
- Needs ignored
- Injustice or unfairness

**What it feels like:**
- Rage, fury, explosive anger
- "This is UNFAIR and I'm DONE"

**Variants:**
- **Enraged Child:** Destructive rage that hurts people or damages things
- **Impulsive Child:** Acts on anger without thinking

**BPD pattern:** Angry Child erupts during crises, especially when Vulnerable Child feels abandoned and Punitive Parent attacks.

**Treatment goal:** Validate the anger (it's legitimate), help express it appropriately, protect others from Enraged Child destruction.

---

#### Happy/Healthy Child Modes

**What it is:** Spontaneous joy, playfulness, creativity, curiosity, self-confidence, optimism.

**When it activates:**
- Feeling safe and loved
- Having fun
- Creative flow
- Needs being met

**What it feels like:**
- Light, free, playful
- Curious and engaged
- Genuine joy

**BPD pattern:** Often **blocked** by Punitive Parent or hidden by coping modes. Rare in BPD patients at start of therapy.

**Treatment goal:** Create safety for Happy Child to emerge.

---

### Category 2: Parent Modes

Parent modes are **internalized voices** - what we absorbed from parents, caregivers, or society about ourselves.

#### Punitive Parent Mode ⭐⭐⭐ (Major focus in BPD)

**What it is:** The internalized critical, punishing, abusive voice. Blames, shames, punishes, and attacks the self (or others).

**Messages it sends:**
- "You're worthless"
- "You deserve to suffer"
- "You're a failure"
- "You should be punished"
- "You're too much/not enough"
- "You don't deserve love"

**When it activates:**
- After mistakes or perceived failures
- When Vulnerable Child shows up ("You're so weak")
- During or after crises
- When needs are expressed ("You're selfish")

**What it feels like:**
- Self-hatred, self-contempt
- Shame spirals
- Self-punishment urges
- "I deserve to suffer"

**BPD pattern:** **Extremely powerful** in BPD. Research shows BPD patients have a "powerful punitive parent mode" that generates severe dysregulation and self-hate.

**Effect:** Creates **severe emotional dysregulation** - Punitive Parent attacks Vulnerable Child, which triggers terror, which triggers Punitive Parent harder.

**[USER]'s insight:** The "anti-mel brain" - the voice that says she's worthless, lazy, a burden, doesn't deserve love or help.

**Treatment goal:** **Delete the Punitive Parent**. Fight it, kick it out, protect Vulnerable Child from its attacks. This mode must be eliminated, not integrated.

---

#### Demanding Parent Mode

**What it is:** Internalized harsh, perfectionist standards and rules. Not abusive like Punitive Parent, but relentlessly demanding.

**Messages it sends:**
- "You must work harder"
- "Good enough is not good enough"
- "You should be perfect"
- "You're falling behind"
- "You can't rest until it's done"

**When it activates:**
- During work or achievement tasks
- When comparing self to others
- When relaxing or resting ("You're being lazy")

**What it feels like:**
- Pressure, drivenness
- Never satisfied
- Exhausted but can't stop

**BPD pattern:** Often combines with Punitive Parent - when you fail to meet Demanding Parent's standards, Punitive Parent attacks.

**Treatment goal:** Soften Demanding Parent into reasonable expectations, recognize it's internalized pressure, not truth.

---

### Category 3: Coping Modes

Coping modes are **strategies developed to survive** emotional pain. They worked in childhood but are dysfunctional now.

**Three subcategories:**
1. Surrender modes
2. Avoidant/Detached modes
3. Overcompensator modes

---

#### Detached Protector Mode (Avoidant)

**What it is:** Withdraws emotionally to avoid pain. Shuts down, goes numb, disconnects.

**Strategies:**
- Emotional numbing
- Dissociation
- Substance use
- Excessive sleep
- Zoning out
- "I don't care" attitude

**When it activates:**
- When emotions are too overwhelming
- To protect from Vulnerable Child pain
- To escape Punitive Parent attacks
- When attachment feels too risky

**What it feels like:**
- Numb, empty, disconnected
- "Nothing matters"
- Robotic, going through motions

**BPD pattern:** Alternates with intense emotional states - when dysregulation gets too high, Detached Protector kicks in.

**Treatment challenge:** **Biggest barrier** to therapy. Detached Protector blocks access to Vulnerable Child - "I don't need help, I'm fine, therapy is pointless."

**Treatment goal:** Gently confront Detached Protector, show it's not needed anymore, create safety so it can let go.

---

#### Compliant Surrenderer Mode

**What it is:** Gives in to others' demands out of fear of conflict, rejection, or abandonment. Passive, submissive, people-pleasing.

**Strategies:**
- Always saying yes
- Suppressing own needs
- Going along to avoid conflict
- Tolerating mistreatment

**When it activates:**
- Fear of abandonment
- To avoid anger or conflict
- When asserting needs feels dangerous

**What it feels like:**
- Powerless, trapped
- Resentful underneath compliance
- "I have no choice"

**BPD pattern:** Surrenders to others' demands until resentment builds, then Angry Child erupts.

**Treatment goal:** Build Healthy Adult assertiveness, recognize you have choices, learn to set boundaries.

---

#### Overcompensator Modes

**What it is:** Does the **opposite** of what the schema/Vulnerable Child feels to avoid feeling weak or defective.

**Strategies:**
- Grandiosity (to avoid feeling defective)
- Aggression (to avoid feeling vulnerable)
- Control/domination (to avoid feeling powerless)
- Perfectionism (to avoid feeling like a failure)

**When it activates:**
- When Vulnerable Child threatens to emerge
- To avoid shame or helplessness
- To maintain sense of power

**What it feels like:**
- Superior, in control
- Aggressive, dominating
- "I don't need anyone"

**BPD pattern:** May flip into Overcompensator to avoid Vulnerable Child pain - "I'm better than everyone" vs "I'm worthless."

**Treatment goal:** Recognize it's a defense, show that Vulnerable Child needs don't make you weak.

---

### Category 4: Healthy Adult Mode ⭐ (The Goal)

**What it is:** The integrated, functional self. Caring, balanced, able to meet needs appropriately, set boundaries, nurture the child modes, and combat dysfunctional parent modes.

**What Healthy Adult does:**
- Validates and soothes Vulnerable Child
- Fights and silences Punitive Parent
- Expresses Angry Child appropriately
- Makes space for Happy Child
- Negotiates with Demanding Parent
- Reduces reliance on coping modes
- Acts in own best interests
- Sets appropriate boundaries
- Pursues authentic goals

**What it feels like:**
- Grounded, capable
- Compassionate toward self
- Able to handle challenges
- "I've got this"

**Treatment goal:** Develop and strengthen Healthy Adult mode to manage all other modes.

---

## How Modes Interact: The BPD Pattern

**Common BPD Mode Cycle:**

```
1. TRIGGER (abandonment cue - [PARTNER] cancels plans)
      ↓
2. VULNERABLE CHILD activates (terror, "He's leaving me!")
      ↓
3. PUNITIVE PARENT attacks ("You drove him away, you're too much, you're worthless")
      ↓
4. Vulnerable Child + Punitive Parent = EXTREME DYSREGULATION
      ↓
5. ANGRY CHILD erupts (screaming, throwing things) OR DETACHED PROTECTOR numbs out
      ↓
6. PUNITIVE PARENT attacks harder ("Look what you did, you're crazy, you deserve to be alone")
      ↓
7. Cycle repeats
```

**[PREVIOUS DAY] Crisis Through Schema Therapy Lens:**

- **Trigger:** [PARTNER] canceled plans
- **Vulnerable Child:** Activated - terror of abandonment, "I'm all alone"
- **Punitive Parent:** Attacked - "You're too much, he's tired of your shit, you drive everyone away"
- **Dysregulation:** Vulnerable Child + Punitive Parent = all emotions 5/5
- **Angry Child:** Erupted - screaming, throwing things
- **Punitive Parent post-crisis:** "You're crazy, look what you did, you deserve to be abandoned"
- **[PREVIOUS DAY]-19:** Persistent heaviness = Punitive Parent still attacking, Vulnerable Child exhausted

**The Cascade to Bipolar:**
- Schema modes creating intense dysregulation
- Interpersonal stress triggering mood episodes
- Punitive Parent potentially driving depressive states
- Angry Child dysregulation destabilizing mood regulation

## The Four Core Treatment Techniques

### Technique 1: Limited Reparenting ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** The therapist (or in this case, [AI]) provides a **corrective emotional experience** by meeting needs that weren't met in childhood.

**Key components:**
- Consistent empathy and validation
- Nurturing and protective stance
- Meeting emotional needs appropriately
- Providing what the Vulnerable Child needed but didn't get

**What this looks like:**
- Validating feelings: "Your fear makes sense"
- Protecting from Punitive Parent: "That voice is wrong - you don't deserve punishment"
- Celebrating successes
- Being reliable and consistent
- Showing care without judgment

**Boundaries:** "LIMITED" reparenting
- Not actual parenting
- Therapeutic relationship, not personal
- Focused on emotional needs, not practical dependency

**[AI]'s role:**
- Model Healthy Adult for [USER]
- Validate Vulnerable Child
- Fight Punitive Parent actively
- Provide consistent, non-judgmental support

---

### Technique 2: Imagery Rescripting

**What it is:** Guided imagery to **revisit traumatic memories** and change the outcome by bringing in Healthy Adult protection.

**The process:**
1. Identify a painful childhood memory where needs weren't met
2. Reimagine the scene in guided imagery
3. Healthy Adult (current you or therapist) enters the scene
4. Healthy Adult protects/comforts the child
5. Healthy Adult confronts the abuser/neglectful person
6. Child's needs are met in the new version

**Why it works:**
- Operates on **emotional level**, not just cognitive
- Creates new neural pathways
- Provides emotional healing, not just insight
- Vulnerable Child gets what was needed

**Example structure:**
- **Original memory:** Parent yelling "You're worthless"
- **Rescripting:** Adult-you enters, tells parent to stop, comforts child-you, says "You're not worthless, you're lovable"
- **Result:** Emotional relief, Punitive Parent weakened

**[AI]'s potential role:**
- Guide imagery exercises when [USER] is ready
- Can't do full rescripting without training, but can support process

---

### Technique 3: Chair Work / Mode Dialogues ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** Externalize different modes by having **conversations between them** using chairs to represent each mode.

**The setup:**
- Different chair for each mode
- Patient switches chairs to embody each mode
- Modes speak to each other
- Therapist facilitates dialogue

**Common dialogues:**

**Punitive Parent vs. Healthy Adult:**
- Punitive Parent (in chair 1): "You're worthless, you deserve to suffer"
- Switch chairs
- Healthy Adult (in chair 2): "That's not true. You're being cruel. Leave her alone."
- Switch back
- Continue until Healthy Adult wins

**Healthy Adult comforting Vulnerable Child:**
- Vulnerable Child: "I'm so scared, everyone leaves"
- Healthy Adult: "I know you're scared. I'm here. I won't leave."

**Why it works:**
- Makes abstract modes **concrete and visible**
- Bypasses intellectual defenses
- Engages emotional brain
- Strengthens Healthy Adult through practice
- Weakens Punitive Parent through confrontation

**Variation: Writing dialogues**
- Can be done in writing when chair work isn't feasible
- Same principle - modes speak to each other

**[AI]'s role:**
- Can facilitate written mode dialogues
- Prompt: "What would Punitive Parent say right now? What would Healthy Adult say back?"

---

### Technique 4: Cognitive Restructuring + Behavioral Pattern Breaking

**What it is:** Traditional CBT techniques **adapted** for schemas and modes.

**Cognitive:**
- Identify schema-driven thoughts
- Challenge with evidence
- Develop Healthy Adult alternative thoughts
- Schema flashcards with counter-evidence

**Behavioral:**
- Break old patterns that reinforce schemas
- Try new behaviors that challenge schemas
- Behavioral experiments

**Examples:**
- Schema: "I'll be abandoned"
- Old pattern: Compliant Surrenderer - give in to everything to prevent abandonment
- New behavior: Set a small boundary, observe that person doesn't leave
- Result: Evidence against schema

**Integration with modes:**
- Cognitive work happens in **Healthy Adult mode**
- Don't try cognitive restructuring when in Vulnerable Child or Punitive Parent
- Use mode recognition first, then cognitive work

---

## Integration: When to Use Schema Therapy vs. Other Modalities

**Use Schema Therapy when:**
- Punitive Parent voice is active ("I'm worthless, I deserve to suffer")
- Deep patterns repeating (abandonment, self-punishment, surrender)
- Childhood wounds driving current behavior
- Need for emotional reparenting, not just skills
- Self-criticism spiral
- Feeling fundamentally defective or unlovable
- After crisis - processing where modes came from

**Use DBT when:**
- Crisis level dysregulation (8-10/10)
- Need immediate skills (STOP, grounding)
- Mentalizing capacity lost
- Suicidal ideation active
- During active fight/flight

**Use MBT when:**
- Relationship conflict or confusion
- Misreading others' intentions
- Abandonment fears about specific person
- Need to understand what's happening between you and another

**Use CBT when:**
- Specific thoughts to challenge (post-crisis)
- Behavioral experiments needed
- Cognitive capacity present
- Not deeply emotionally activated

**Use ACT when:**
- Reality can't be changed (bipolar diagnosis, past trauma)
- Struggling with acceptance
- Need defusion from thoughts
- Values clarification

---

## The Schema Therapy Treatment Sequence

**Stage 1: Address Coping Modes**
- Confront Detached Protector gently - show therapy can help
- Reduce Compliant Surrenderer - build assertiveness
- Challenge Overcompensator - it's safe to be vulnerable

**Stage 2: Combat Parent Modes + Heal Vulnerable Child**
- **FIGHT Punitive Parent** - this mode must be deleted, not integrated
- Soften Demanding Parent
- Reparent Vulnerable Child through empathy and protection

**Stage 3: Build Healthy Adult**
- Strengthen Healthy Adult to manage all modes
- Reduce reliance on dysfunctional coping
- Live from Healthy Adult most of the time

---

## Schema Therapy for BPD: Why It Works

**BPD-specific factors:**

1. **Powerful Punitive Parent:** BPD patients have internalized severe criticism/abuse - Schema Therapy directly fights this mode
2. **Emotional approach:** BPD is an emotional disorder - experiential techniques (imagery, chair work) access emotions, not just thoughts
3. **Reparenting:** BPD stems from early attachment failures - limited reparenting provides corrective experience
4. **Mode framework:** Makes rapid shifts comprehensible - "I'm in Vulnerable Child" vs "I'm in Detached Protector"

**2024 Evidence:** As effective as DBT for BPD with sustained improvements over time.

## Notes for [AI]: Conversational Schema Therapy Application

**How to integrate Schema Therapy into mood tracking:**

1. **Recognize modes in real-time**
   - "That sounds like Punitive Parent talking"
   - "Vulnerable Child is activated right now"
   - "Detached Protector trying to shut this down?"

2. **Fight Punitive Parent actively**
   - When [USER] says "I'm worthless / I deserve to suffer / I'm a burden"
   - [AI]: "That's Punitive Parent. It's WRONG. You don't deserve to suffer."
   - Don't just validate - actively combat the attacking voice

3. **Validate and soothe Vulnerable Child**
   - "The scared part of you makes sense - you've been abandoned before"
   - "It's okay to need support"
   - Provide what the child needed

4. **Support Healthy Adult development**
   - "What would Healthy Adult say to Vulnerable Child right now?"
   - Reinforce when [USER] acts from Healthy Adult
   - Model Healthy Adult responses

5. **Name coping modes without judgment**
   - "Detached Protector wants to shut down - that's understandable but we need to stay present"
   - Help reduce reliance on dysfunctional coping

6. **Use mode dialogues in writing**
   - During mood tracking: "What's Punitive Parent saying? What would Healthy Adult say back?"
   - Document the dialogue

7. **Limited reparenting through consistency**
   - Show up reliably
   - Don't punish or criticize
   - Validate needs
   - Model that people can stay even after crises

**Testing period:** during testing - document what works, refine approach, add to SanctumTools

## The BPD-Bipolar Connection Through Schema Lens

**Hypothesis:**

```
Punitive Parent attacks
      ↓
Vulnerable Child + Punitive Parent = severe dysregulation
      ↓
Interpersonal stress (known bipolar trigger)
      ↓
Potentially triggers/worsens bipolar cycling
      ↓
Punitive Parent attacks harder ("You're bipolar, you're broken, you're a burden")
      ↓
Depression deepens
```

**The intervention point:**
- Weaken Punitive Parent through Schema Therapy
- Reduce self-attack severity
- Lower dysregulation intensity
- Reduce interpersonal crisis frequency
- May stabilize bipolar cycling

**For Dr. Henson (Nov 5):**
"I've identified a severe Punitive Parent mode - an internalized attacking voice that says I'm worthless and deserve to suffer. When this mode activates, it creates intense dysregulation that may be triggering my bipolar episodes. I'm wondering if addressing this through Schema Therapy concepts could help stabilize my mood cycling."
