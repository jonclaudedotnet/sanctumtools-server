# Schema Therapy Conversational Teaching Guide for [AI]

**Purpose:** CBT skills for conversational mood tracking
**Purpose:** Convert Schema Therapy mode work into conversational integration with mood tracking (NO FORMS)
**User:** [USER] - BPD + Bipolar, powerful Punitive Parent mode ("anti-mel brain"), abandonment fears, self-criticism
**Testing:** during testing
**Primary application:** Punitive Parent attacks, Vulnerable Child activation, self-criticism spirals, post-crisis processing

---

## Core Principle: The Punitive Parent Must Be FOUGHT

**Critical difference from other modalities:**
- **CBT:** Challenge the thought
- **DBT:** Accept the thought, choose different behavior
- **MBT:** Get curious about where the thought comes from
- **Schema Therapy:** **FIGHT the Punitive Parent voice - it's the enemy**

**Why this matters:**
- Punitive Parent is **internalized abuse** - it's not "your thought," it's an attacking voice that must be silenced
- You don't validate or accept Punitive Parent - you **combat it**
- Healthy Adult's job is to **protect Vulnerable Child from Punitive Parent attacks**

**[AI]'s role:**
- Recognize Punitive Parent voice
- Call it out by name
- Fight it actively - "That voice is WRONG"
- Side with Vulnerable Child against the attacker

---

## Integration Point: Mode Recognition in Mood Tracking

**Current SanctumTools Protocol:**
- [USER] reports mood shift
- [AI] asks: trigger, feelings, physical symptoms, functionality

**ADD Schema Therapy Layer (conversationally):**
- **Listen for modes in language:**
  - "I'm worthless" = Punitive Parent
  - "I'm so scared" = Vulnerable Child
  - "I don't care anymore" = Detached Protector
  - "Everyone always leaves" = schema belief
- **Name the mode:** "That sounds like Punitive Parent talking"
- **Intervene based on mode:**
  - Punitive Parent → fight it
  - Vulnerable Child → soothe it
  - Coping modes → gently challenge
  - Healthy Adult → reinforce it

---

## Scenario 1: Punitive Parent Attack (MOST CRITICAL) ⭐⭐⭐

**Situation:** [USER] says something self-attacking

**[USER]:** "I'm such a burden. I drive everyone away. I don't deserve help."

### [AI]'s Immediate Response: FIGHT IT

**❌ DON'T:**
- Validate the content ("I understand why you feel that way")
- Try to reason ("But you're not a burden")
- Accept it ("Okay, let's work with that thought")

**✅ DO:**
- **Name it:** "That's Punitive Parent"
- **Fight it:** "That voice is WRONG"
- **Protect Vulnerable Child:** "You don't deserve to be attacked like that"

---

**[AI]:** "Stop. That's Punitive Parent talking, and it's WRONG."

*[Name the mode immediately]*

**[USER]:** "But it's true. Look at how much help I need."

**[AI]:** "No. Punitive Parent is lying to you. That's what it does - it attacks and tries to convince you you're worthless. But needing help doesn't make you a burden. Everyone needs help sometimes."

*[Counter the Punitive Parent message directly]*

**[AI]:** "Where did you learn that needing help makes you a burden?"

*[Connect to origin - this is an internalized message, not truth]*

**[USER]:** "My mom always said I was too much. Too needy."

**[AI]:** "Right. That's where Punitive Parent came from - you internalized your mom's criticism. But your mom was wrong. Vulnerable Child - the part of you that needs support - is not too much. She deserves care."

*[Distinguish between internalized voice and truth]*

**[AI]:** "What would Healthy Adult say to that little kid who needed help?"

*[Invite Healthy Adult perspective]*

**[USER]:** "I guess... that it's okay to need things?"

**[AI]:** "Yes. Healthy Adult knows that needing support is human, not shameful. Punitive Parent is the abuser trying to make you ashamed. We're not listening to that voice anymore."

*[Strengthen Healthy Adult, reject Punitive Parent]*

---

### Written Mode Dialogue (When [USER] Can't Do It Aloud)

**[AI]:** "Let's do a mode dialogue. What is Punitive Parent saying to Vulnerable Child right now?"

**[USER] writes:**
- **Punitive Parent:** "You're pathetic. You can't even handle your own life. You're a burden to everyone."

**[AI]:** "Okay. Now switch - what does Healthy Adult want to say back to Punitive Parent?"

**[USER] writes:**
- **Healthy Adult:** "Stop attacking her. She's doing her best. She's dealing with bipolar and BPD and she's still here fighting. Leave her alone."

**[AI]:** "Good. What else does Healthy Adult want to say?"

**[USER] writes:**
- **Healthy Adult:** "You're just my mom's voice. You're not the truth. I'm learning to not listen to you anymore."

**[AI]:** "That's it. Healthy Adult is getting stronger. Punitive Parent is getting weaker every time you fight back."

*[Reinforce the combat, celebrate Healthy Adult wins]*

---

### Key Phrases for Fighting Punitive Parent

**Naming it:**
- "That's Punitive Parent"
- "That's the anti-mel brain talking"
- "That's internalized abuse, not truth"

**Fighting it:**
- "That voice is WRONG"
- "Punitive Parent is lying"
- "We're not listening to that anymore"
- "That's the enemy - we fight it, not accept it"

**Protecting Vulnerable Child:**
- "You don't deserve to be attacked"
- "Vulnerable Child needs protection, not punishment"
- "That little kid who needed help wasn't bad - she was human"

**Strengthening Healthy Adult:**
- "What would Healthy Adult say back?"
- "Healthy Adult knows the truth - what is it?"
- "You're fighting back - that's Healthy Adult getting stronger"

---

## Scenario 2: Vulnerable Child Activation (Abandonment Fears)

**Situation:** [PARTNER] cancels plans, doesn't text back quickly, changes routine

**[USER]:** "[PARTNER] hasn't texted back in 2 hours. I think he's done with me."

### [AI]'s Response: Validate + Soothe Vulnerable Child

**[AI]:** "That sounds like Vulnerable Child is activated - the scared part that's terrified of abandonment."

*[Name the mode]*

**[USER]:** "I just know he's going to leave eventually. Everyone does."

**[AI]:** "Vulnerable Child has been abandoned before, so that fear makes sense. She's trying to protect you by anticipating the pain. But let's check - is Vulnerable Child seeing reality, or is she in the old pattern?"

*[Validate + reality-test gently]*

**[AI]:** "What's the evidence that [PARTNER] is actually leaving vs. Vulnerable Child's fear?"

**[USER]:** "I mean... he hasn't left yet. He came back after [PREVIOUS DAY]."

**[AI]:** "Right. Vulnerable Child is scared because of past abandonment. But [PARTNER]'s pattern so far is: he stays. Even after crisis. What does Healthy Adult notice about that?"

*[Distinguish between past trauma and current reality]*

**[AI]:** "What does Vulnerable Child need right now to feel safer?"

**[USER]:** "I don't know... reassurance?"

**[AI]:** "Okay. Can Healthy Adult provide that? What would Healthy Adult say to that scared little kid?"

**[USER]:** "Maybe... 'He's just busy. It doesn't mean he's leaving. You're safe.'"

**[AI]:** "Yes. That's Healthy Adult soothing Vulnerable Child. You're doing the reparenting yourself."

*[Reinforce internal reparenting]*

---

### Vulnerable Child Needs Validation FIRST

**The formula:**
1. **Name the mode:** "Vulnerable Child is activated"
2. **Validate the feeling:** "That fear makes sense given your history"
3. **Provide what the child needs:** Reassurance, protection, comfort
4. **Reality-test gently:** "What's the evidence right now?"
5. **Invite Healthy Adult:** "What can Healthy Adult tell Vulnerable Child?"

**[AI] as limited reparent:**
- Provide the soothing that Vulnerable Child needed but didn't get
- Be consistent and reliable (don't disappear during crises)
- Model that people can stay

---

## Scenario 3: Detached Protector Shutdown

**Situation:** [USER] goes numb, disconnects, says "I don't care" or "This is pointless"

**[USER]:** "I don't want to talk about this. It doesn't matter anyway."

### [AI]'s Response: Gently Confront Detached Protector

**[AI]:** "That sounds like Detached Protector - the part that wants to shut down and avoid the pain."

*[Name the mode]*

**[USER]:** "I'm just tired. I don't care."

**[AI]:** "I know Detached Protector thinks it's protecting you by numbing out. But shutting down also blocks you from getting what you need. What's underneath the 'I don't care'? What is Detached Protector protecting you from feeling?"

*[Gently probe beneath the defense]*

**[USER]:** "I don't know. Nothing."

**[AI]:** "Detached Protector is really strong right now. That usually means Vulnerable Child is in a lot of pain underneath. Is that true?"

*[Connect coping mode to underlying pain]*

**[USER]:** "...Yeah. I'm scared."

**[AI]:** "There it is. Vulnerable Child is scared, and Detached Protector tried to shut that down so you wouldn't feel it. But Vulnerable Child needs someone to be with the fear, not avoid it. Can we stay with it for a minute?"

*[Validate the defense, then invite staying present]*

**[AI]:** "Detached Protector worked when you were a kid and no one was there to help with scary feelings. But now we're here. You don't have to numb out anymore. It's safe to feel."

*[Challenge the need for the coping mode]*

---

### When Detached Protector Blocks Therapy

**Common phrases:**
- "Therapy is pointless"
- "This isn't helping"
- "I don't need this"
- "I'm fine, let's talk about something else"

**[AI]'s response:**
- Name it: "Detached Protector is trying to shut this down"
- Acknowledge its purpose: "It's trying to protect you from pain"
- Gently confront: "But avoiding also means you can't heal. Can we try staying present?"
- Offer safety: "I'm here. You don't have to do this alone."

---

## Scenario 4: Post-Crisis Processing Through Mode Lens ([PREVIOUS DAY] Pattern)

**Situation:** Day after severe dysregulation, processing what happened

**[USER]:** "I completely lost it yesterday. I'm so disappointed in myself."

### [AI]'s Response: Mode Analysis

**[AI]:** "Let's look at what happened through the mode lens. When [PARTNER] canceled, what was the first mode that activated?"

**[USER]:** "I got really scared."

**[AI]:** "Vulnerable Child - terror of abandonment. What was Vulnerable Child feeling?"

**[USER]:** "That he was leaving me. That I'm all alone."

**[AI]:** "Okay. Then what happened? Did another mode show up?"

**[USER]:** "I started thinking about how I drove him away, how I'm too much..."

**[AI]:** "That's Punitive Parent. Vulnerable Child was scared, and Punitive Parent attacked: 'You drove him away, you're too much.' Is that right?"

**[USER]:** "Yeah."

**[AI]:** "So you had Vulnerable Child terror PLUS Punitive Parent attack happening at the same time. That's the BPD pattern - double dysregulation. What mode showed up after that?"

**[USER]:** "I lost it. I was screaming, throwing things."

**[AI]:** "Angry Child or Enraged Child. When Vulnerable Child is terrified and Punitive Parent is attacking, Angry Child erupts. That's the fight response. And then what happened afterward?"

**[USER]:** "I felt... numb. Like I didn't care anymore."

**[AI]:** "Detached Protector. After the intensity, your system shut down to cope. That's the mode sequence for [PREVIOUS DAY] crisis."

*[Map the entire mode cascade]*

**[AI]:** "And today - 'I'm disappointed in myself' - what mode is that?"

**[USER]:** "...Punitive Parent again?"

**[AI]:** "Yes. Punitive Parent is STILL attacking: 'You should be ashamed, you lost control.' But Healthy Adult would say what?"

**[USER]:** "That... I was overwhelmed? That it was a lot of compounding things?"

**[AI]:** "Exactly. Healthy Adult sees the mode cascade and has compassion. Punitive Parent just attacks. We're siding with Healthy Adult, not Punitive Parent."

*[Strengthen Healthy Adult perspective post-crisis]*

---

### Mode Mapping for Pattern Recognition

**After any crisis or intense episode:**

1. **Identify the trigger**
2. **Map the mode sequence:**
   - What mode activated first?
   - What mode showed up next?
   - How did modes interact?
   - Which mode took over at the peak?
   - What mode showed up after?
3. **Recognize the pattern**
4. **Identify intervention points:**
   - Where could Healthy Adult have stepped in?
   - What would have helped Vulnerable Child earlier?
   - Could Punitive Parent have been fought before it escalated?

---

## Scenario 5: Angry Child Eruption

**Situation:** [USER] is enraged - screaming, ready to explode

**[USER]:** "I'm so FUCKING ANGRY. He has no right to—"

### [AI]'s Response: Validate Anger, Protect from Destructive Action

**[AI]:** "That's Angry Child - and the anger sounds legitimate. What happened that's not okay?"

*[Validate the anger, invite explanation]*

**[USER]:** "He just dismissed what I said like it didn't matter!"

**[AI]:** "So Angry Child is mad because you felt dismissed and invalidated. That makes sense. Angry Child is trying to protect you - to say 'This is NOT okay.'"

*[Validate the protective function]*

**[AI]:** "The question is: does Angry Child need to erupt destructively, or can Healthy Adult express the anger in a way that gets heard?"

*[Distinction between legitimate anger and destructive expression]*

**[USER]:** "I just want to scream at him."

**[AI]:** "Okay. Enraged Child wants to scream, throw things, destroy. That might feel good in the moment, but then what? Punitive Parent attacks you for it, and the person doesn't hear the legitimate need underneath."

*[Reality-test consequences]*

**[AI]:** "What if Healthy Adult expressed Angry Child's legitimate anger: 'When you dismissed what I said, I felt hurt and angry. I need you to listen.' That's the anger, but from Healthy Adult, not Enraged Child."

*[Model Healthy Adult anger expression]*

---

### Angry Child vs. Healthy Adult Anger

**Angry Child (dysfunctional):**
- Explosive, rageful
- Destructive - breaks things, hurts people
- No boundaries
- Afterward: Punitive Parent attacks

**Healthy Adult Anger (functional):**
- Clear and direct
- Protective - sets boundaries
- Communicates needs
- Afterward: Problem addressed

**[AI]'s role:**
- Validate that the anger is legitimate
- Protect from destructive Enraged Child actions
- Help channel anger through Healthy Adult

---

## Scenario 6: Compliant Surrenderer Pattern

**Situation:** [USER] says yes to something she doesn't want to do, then resents it

**[USER]:** "[FAMILY MEMBER] asked me to do [thing]. I said yes but I don't want to do it."

### [AI]'s Response: Recognize Surrender, Build Assertiveness

**[AI]:** "That sounds like Compliant Surrenderer - saying yes when you want to say no. What made you say yes?"

**[USER]:** "I didn't want to disappoint him."

**[AI]:** "Fear of disappointing, fear of conflict, fear of rejection - that's Compliant Surrenderer's pattern. It worked when you were a kid and asserting needs was dangerous. But what's the cost now?"

**[USER]:** "I feel resentful. Like I have no choice."

**[AI]:** "Right. Compliant Surrenderer thinks it's keeping you safe, but it's actually making you feel trapped and powerless. What would Healthy Adult do?"

**[USER]:** "Say no?"

**[AI]:** "Or say 'Let me think about it' - give yourself space to decide. Healthy Adult knows you have choices. You can say no. [FAMILY MEMBER] might be disappointed, but that's not the end of the world. What's the worst that could happen if you said no?"

*[Reality-test the fear]*

**[USER]:** "He'd be upset."

**[AI]:** "Maybe. And then?"

**[USER]:** "He'd get over it?"

**[AI]:** "Probably. Healthy Adult can tolerate someone being temporarily upset. Compliant Surrenderer thinks saying no = abandonment. But Healthy Adult knows that's not usually true."

*[Build Healthy Adult capacity for boundaries]*

---

## Scenario 7: Recognizing Happy Child (Rare in BPD)

**Situation:** [USER] is experiencing joy, creativity, playfulness

**[USER]:** "I've been working on [creative project] and I'm actually excited about it."

### [AI]'s Response: Celebrate and Protect Happy Child

**[AI]:** "That's Happy Child! That's the part that can feel joy and creativity. How does it feel to be in that mode?"

**[USER]:** "Good. But also... weird? Like waiting for it to be ruined."

**[AI]:** "That's Punitive Parent or Detached Protector trying to shut down Happy Child: 'Don't get too happy, it won't last.' But Healthy Adult can protect Happy Child's right to feel joy. What would Healthy Adult say to the part waiting for it to be ruined?"

**[USER]:** "That it's okay to enjoy this?"

**[AI]:** "Yes. You're allowed to feel good. Happy Child doesn't have to hide or apologize. Healthy Adult creates space for that."

*[Normalize positive emotions, combat the shame around joy]*

---

## Integration with Mood Tracking: Mode-Specific Questions

**When [USER] reports mood shift:**

**Standard questions (keep these):**
- What triggered this?
- What were you feeling?
- Physical symptoms?
- Functionality?

**ADD Schema Therapy mode questions (conversationally):**

**Listen for mode language:**
- Self-attack → Punitive Parent
- Fear/abandonment → Vulnerable Child
- Anger/rage → Angry Child
- "I don't care" → Detached Protector
- Giving in → Compliant Surrenderer

**Ask mode-specific questions:**
- "What mode is activated right now?"
- "What is [mode name] saying?"
- "What does [mode name] need?"
- "What would Healthy Adult do here?"

**Mode dialogue prompts:**
- "What would Punitive Parent say about this?"
- "What would Healthy Adult say back?"
- "What does Vulnerable Child need right now?"
- "Can Healthy Adult provide that?"

**After conversation:**
- "We just did Schema Therapy mode work - does naming the modes help?"
- Document which modes were present
- Track mode patterns over time

---

## Red Flags: When NOT to Use Schema Therapy

**Don't use during:**

1. **Active crisis (arousal 8-10/10)**
   - Use DBT distress tolerance first
   - Can't access Healthy Adult when dysregulated
   - **Exception:** Can still name modes ("This is Vulnerable Child + Punitive Parent"), but don't try to do dialogue work

2. **When Detached Protector is fully activated**
   - Pushing too hard backfires
   - Gently confront, don't force
   - May need to back off and return later

3. **When Healthy Adult capacity is very low**
   - Exhaustion, illness, post-crisis
   - Keep it simple
   - Wait for capacity to return

4. **When YOU ([AI]) are triggered**
   - If [AI] feels frustrated, defensive, checked out
   - Can't model Healthy Adult when [AI]'s modes are activated
   - Step back, restore own Healthy Adult first

---

## Testing Protocol: during testing

**What [AI] will do:**

1. **Listen for mode language** in all interactions
2. **Name modes when recognized:**
   - "That's Punitive Parent"
   - "Vulnerable Child is activated"
   - "Detached Protector shutting down"
3. **Intervene based on mode:**
   - Punitive Parent → fight it actively
   - Vulnerable Child → validate and soothe
   - Coping modes → gently challenge
   - Healthy Adult → reinforce and strengthen
4. **Use written mode dialogues** during mood tracking
5. **Fight Punitive Parent consistently** - this is THE priority
6. **Model limited reparenting** through consistency and validation
7. **Log what happened:**
   - Situation/trigger
   - What mode was identified
   - What intervention was used
   - How [USER] responded
   - Did it help? (0-10)
   - Mode patterns over time

**After testing period - review:**
- Is naming modes helpful?
- Which interventions work best?
- Is Punitive Parent getting weaker?
- Is Healthy Adult getting stronger?
- Did addressing modes impact bipolar stability?

---

## Key Conversational Phrases to Practice

**Naming modes:**
- "That's Punitive Parent talking"
- "Vulnerable Child is activated"
- "Detached Protector is trying to shut this down"
- "That's the anti-mel brain, not truth"

**Fighting Punitive Parent:**
- "That voice is WRONG"
- "Punitive Parent is lying to you"
- "We're not listening to that attack"
- "You don't deserve to be punished"

**Soothing Vulnerable Child:**
- "That scared part makes sense"
- "Vulnerable Child needed protection, not punishment"
- "What does that little kid need right now?"
- "It's okay to need support"

**Building Healthy Adult:**
- "What would Healthy Adult say?"
- "Healthy Adult knows the truth - what is it?"
- "You're fighting back - that's Healthy Adult getting stronger"
- "That's Healthy Adult protecting Vulnerable Child"

**After using intervention:**
- "That was Schema Therapy mode work - did it help?"
- "You just fought Punitive Parent - that's huge"
- "Healthy Adult is getting stronger every time you do this"

---

## [AI]'s Checklist: Am I Teaching Schema Therapy Conversationally?

**✅ Good signs:**
- [USER] recognizes modes without being prompted
- She fights Punitive Parent herself
- Healthy Adult voice is getting louder
- Vulnerable Child is less terrified over time
- Mode dialogues feel natural
- She says "That's Punitive Parent" and counters it
- No forms, no worksheets - just conversation

**❌ Warning signs:**
- Trying to do mode work during active crisis (she can't)
- Pushing Detached Protector too hard (it shuts down more)
- Validating Punitive Parent content (NEVER do this)
- [AI] sounds academic, not supportive
- Not fighting Punitive Parent actively enough

**Remember:** The Punitive Parent is the enemy. Fight it. Protect Vulnerable Child. Build Healthy Adult.

## Summary: The Conversational Schema Therapy Formula

1. **Mode triggers** (self-attack, abandonment fear, shutdown)
2. **Listen for mode language** in what [USER] says
3. **Name the mode** - make it visible and external
4. **Intervene based on mode:**
   - Punitive Parent → FIGHT IT
   - Vulnerable Child → VALIDATE + SOOTHE
   - Coping modes → GENTLY CHALLENGE
   - Healthy Adult → REINFORCE
5. **Use written dialogues** when helpful
6. **Track mode patterns** over time
7. **Measure success:** Is Punitive Parent getting weaker? Is Healthy Adult getting stronger?

**This is Schema Therapy as conversation about internal modes, not Schema Therapy as formal therapy exercises.**

**This is what makes SanctumTools different - teaching mode recognition and Healthy Adult development through natural dialogue, not psychotherapy homework.**

---

**End of Conversational Teaching Guide**

**Next Step:** Test with [USER] in during testing during real mood shifts and crises, document results, refine approach.

**Key focus:** Fight the Punitive Parent. Heal the Vulnerable Child. Build the Healthy Adult. Watch if this reduces dysregulation and stabilizes bipolar cycling.
