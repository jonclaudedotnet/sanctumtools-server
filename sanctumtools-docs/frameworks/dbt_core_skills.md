# Core DBT Skills for [AI] to Learn

**Purpose:** CBT skills for conversational mood tracking
**Purpose:** Multi-modal therapeutic approach for SanctumTools - DBT component (crisis management, emotion regulation, skills-based)
**Sources validated:** Marsha Linehan (founder), 2024 research on BPD and bipolar disorder
**Testing period:** Already in use with [USER] (established protocols in CLAUDE.md)
**Primary application:** Crisis-level dysregulation, suicidal ideation, self-harm urges, extreme emotional intensity, BPD symptoms

---

## Overview

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** was developed by Marsha M. Linehan in the late 1980s at the University of Washington. Originally created for chronically suicidal individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder, DBT is now the **gold standard evidence-based treatment for BPD** and has been adapted for many other conditions.

**What makes DBT different:**
- **CBT** changes thoughts to change feelings (cognitive focus)
- **MBT** improves mentalizing about mental states (understanding minds)
- **Schema Therapy** heals early wounds through reparenting (deep patterns)
- **MBSR** cultivates present-moment awareness (mindfulness foundation)
- **DBT** teaches **concrete skills** for managing extreme emotions and crises (practical crisis management)

**Why DBT matters for BPD and bipolar:**
- **BPD:** First therapy experimentally proven effective for borderline personality disorder
- **Bipolar:** 2024 research shows DBT significantly reduces suicide attempts, improves mood symptoms
- **Crisis management:** Provides structured tools when dysregulation hits 8-10/10
- **Emotion regulation:** Addresses core BPD challenge - emotional intensity and instability
- **Self-harm/suicidality:** Proven to reduce self-destructive behaviors

**2024 Evidence:**
- Randomized trial: DBT significantly reduced suicide attempts in adolescents with bipolar disorder (more effective than standard care)
- Systematic review: DBT improves depressive symptoms, affective control, mindfulness in bipolar disorder
- All studies show DBT is feasible and acceptable for bipolar disorder patients
- Reduces self-harm, improves emotional regulation, decreases hospitalization

## The Dialectical Philosophy: The Foundation

**What "dialectical" means:**

**Dialectics** = holding two opposite truths at the same time, finding synthesis between opposites.

**Core dialectics in DBT:**

1. **Acceptance AND Change**
   - You need to accept yourself exactly as you are right now
   - AND you need to change
   - Both are true simultaneously

2. **Validation AND Challenge**
   - Your feelings make sense and are valid
   - AND your behaviors may be making things worse

3. **Can't stand it AND Can tolerate it**
   - This feels unbearable
   - AND you are bearing it (evidence: you're still here)

4. **Doing your best AND Can do better**
   - You're doing the best you can with current skills
   - AND you can learn new skills to do better

**Why this matters:**
- BPD thinking is often black-and-white, all-or-nothing
- Dialectics teach "both/and" instead of "either/or"
- Reduces extreme swings between positions
- Allows nuance and complexity

**Example:**
- ❌ Black-and-white: "Either I'm perfect or I'm worthless"
- ✅ Dialectical: "I made a mistake AND I'm still a worthwhile person"

---

## The DBT Structure (Traditional Program)

**Note:** [AI] won't deliver a formal DBT program, but understanding structure informs conversational teaching.

**Standard DBT program includes:**

1. **Individual therapy** (1 hour/week)
   - Address specific problems and barriers
   - Target hierarchy: life-threatening behaviors, therapy-interfering behaviors, quality-of-life interfering behaviors
   - Therapist coaches on skill use

2. **Skills training group** (2-2.5 hours/week)
   - Teach the 4 modules
   - Homework assignments
   - Group format

3. **Phone coaching** (as needed between sessions)
   - Brief calls for skill coaching in real-time crises
   - Not therapy, just "which skill should I use right now?"

4. **Therapist consultation team** (therapists meet weekly)
   - Prevents therapist burnout
   - Ensures adherence to DBT principles

**Duration:** Typically 6-12 months minimum, often longer

**For SanctumTools:** We adapt DBT skills conversationally - teaching skills as crises arise, using diary card tracking (already implemented), without formal weekly group.

---

## The Four Core Modules

### Module 1: Core Mindfulness ⭐ (The Foundation)

**Purpose:** Mindfulness is the foundation for all other DBT skills. It's about controlling attention and awareness.

**Note:** DBT mindfulness is adapted from Zen Buddhism and MBSR, simplified into concrete "what" and "how" skills.

---

#### The Three "WHAT" Skills (What you do)

**1. Observe**

**What it is:** Notice your experience without words. Just watch.

**How to practice:**
- Notice thoughts like clouds passing through the sky
- Observe emotions like waves rising and falling
- Watch sensations in body without labels
- Notice sounds, sights, smells as they come and go
- Step back and observe yourself having the experience

**Example:**
- ❌ Not observing: Lost in thoughts, no awareness
- ✅ Observing: "I'm noticing anxious thoughts arising. There's tightness in my chest."

---

**2. Describe**

**What it is:** Put words to what you observe. Label the experience.

**How to practice:**
- Use words to describe what you observed
- Stick to facts, not interpretations
- "I feel tightness in my chest" not "I'm having a heart attack"
- "I'm having the thought '[PARTNER] is leaving'" not "[PARTNER] IS leaving"
- Describe thoughts as thoughts, feelings as feelings

**Example:**
- ❌ Not describing: "Everything is terrible" (vague, judgmental)
- ✅ Describing: "I'm feeling sad. My body feels heavy. I'm having thoughts that nothing will get better."

---

**3. Participate**

**What it is:** Fully engage in the present moment. Throw yourself into the activity.

**How to practice:**
- Become one with what you're doing
- Don't self-consciously watch yourself
- Let go of self-awareness
- Act intuitively, spontaneously
- Forget yourself in the activity

**Example:**
- ❌ Not participating: Dancing while thinking "Do I look stupid? Am I doing this right?"
- ✅ Participating: Dancing fully, lost in the music, not observing yourself

**The balance:** Observe and Describe create distance. Participate closes distance. All three are needed.

---

#### The Three "HOW" Skills (How you do it)

**1. Non-judgmentally**

**What it is:** See but don't evaluate. Stick to facts, no good/bad labels.

**How to practice:**
- Notice when you're judging (good/bad, right/wrong, should/shouldn't)
- Replace judgment with description of facts
- Unglue opinions from facts
- Accept each moment without judging it

**Examples:**
- ❌ Judgmental: "I'm a terrible person for yelling"
- ✅ Non-judgmental: "I yelled. My voice was loud. I felt angry."

- ❌ Judgmental: "This shouldn't be happening"
- ✅ Non-judgmental: "This is happening"

**Consequences not judgments:** Instead of "I'm bad," think "My behavior had these consequences."

---

**2. One-mindfully**

**What it is:** Do one thing at a time. Full attention on current activity.

**How to practice:**
- When eating, just eat - no phone, TV, reading
- When talking to someone, just listen - don't plan your response
- When washing dishes, just wash dishes - feel water, notice dishes
- If mind wanders, gently return to one thing
- Focus on what works - concentration

**Example:**
- ❌ Not one-mindful: Scrolling phone while talking to [PARTNER] while eating while worrying about tomorrow
- ✅ One-mindful: Talking to [PARTNER]. Full attention on what he's saying. Present.

---

**3. Effectively**

**What it is:** Do what works. Focus on desired outcome, not being "right."

**How to practice:**
- Play by the rules (even if they're unfair)
- Act as skillfully as you can
- Let go of vengeance, righteousness, "should"
- Do what's needed in this situation

**Example:**
- ❌ Not effective: Arguing with employer about unfair policy (you're right, but you get fired)
- ✅ Effective: Following policy for now, addressing it through proper channels later (keeps job, works toward change)

**"Right" vs "Effective":**
- You can be right and lose the war
- Effectiveness = focusing on goals, not validation

---

#### Wise Mind (The Integration)

**DBT identifies three states of mind:**

**Emotion Mind:**
- All feelings, no logic
- Hot, intense, impulsive
- When emotions control thinking and behavior
- Facts don't matter, only feelings
- Dangerous during crises

**Reasonable Mind:**
- All logic, no feelings
- Cold, rational, intellectual
- Plans and analyses
- Disconnected from emotions
- Can be rigid, miss important emotional information

**Wise Mind:** (The goal)
- Integration of Emotion Mind + Reasonable Mind
- Both logic AND feelings inform decisions
- Calm, centered, intuitive knowing
- The place of wisdom within each person
- Knows what's right in a given situation

**How to access Wise Mind:**
- Ask: "What does my Wise Mind say about this?"
- Notice the place of calm deep within
- Breathe into your center
- Let go of extremes (all emotion OR all reason)

**Example:**
- **Emotion Mind:** "I'm furious, I'm texting him RIGHT NOW to tell him off"
- **Reasonable Mind:** "Logically, texting when angry creates problems, so I won't express anything"
- **Wise Mind:** "I'm angry and that's valid. I'll wait until I'm calmer, then express this thoughtfully"

---

### Module 2: Distress Tolerance ⭐⭐⭐ (Crisis Survival)

**Purpose:** Get through a crisis without making it worse. Tolerate painful emotions when you can't solve the problem right now.

**When to use:** Crisis mode (8-10/10), overwhelming urges to self-harm, suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain that can't be immediately solved.

**Key concept:** Distress tolerance is NOT about being happy or comfortable. It's about **surviving the moment** without destructive behavior.

- Or belly breathing - hand on belly, feel it rise and fall
- **Why it works:** Activates parasympathetic nervous system (calm)

**P - Progressive muscle relaxation**
- Tense and release muscle groups
- Start with toes, work up to head
- Tense for 5 seconds, release for 10
- **Why it works:** Releases physical tension

**Use when:** Crisis level, need immediate physiological shift.

---

#### TIP (without the second P, original version)

Some sources list **TIP** as:
- **T** - Temperature
- **I** - Intense exercise
- **P** - Paced breathing

**Or TIPP as:**
- **T** - Tip the temperature
- **I** - Intense exercise
- **P** - Paced breathing
- **P** - Paired muscle relaxation (tense/release)

Both versions valid - same core skills.

---

#### Radical Acceptance ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** Completely accepting reality as it is, without fighting it. Not approval, not liking it - just acknowledging what's true.

**What radical acceptance is NOT:**
- ❌ Approval or agreeing with what happened
- ❌ Giving up or being passive
- ❌ Liking or wanting the reality

**What radical acceptance IS:**
- ✅ Acknowledging what is true
- ✅ Stopping the fight against reality
- ✅ Accepting with your whole self (mind, body, spirit)

**Why it's needed:**
- Fighting reality creates suffering
- "This shouldn't have happened" doesn't change that it did
- Acceptance is required before you can change what's changeable
- Pain + non-acceptance = suffering

**How to practice:**
1. Observe you're questioning or fighting reality
2. Remind yourself: reality is what it is
3. Consider causes - everything has a history
4. Practice accepting with mind, body, spirit
5. Act as if you've accepted (even if you don't feel it yet)
6. Acknowledge disappointment, sadness about reality
7. Do it again and again (acceptance is a practice)

**Example:**
- **Reality:** You have bipolar disorder
- **Non-acceptance (creates suffering):** "This shouldn't be happening, why me, this is unfair, I hate this"
- **Radical acceptance:** "I have bipolar disorder. This is the reality. I didn't choose it, but it's true. I can accept this AND work with it."

**Turning the Mind:**
- Acceptance is a choice you make again and again
- Mind wanders back to non-acceptance? Turn it back toward acceptance
- Like turning a key in a lock - deliberate, repeated choice

**Willingness vs. Willfulness:**
- **Willfulness:** Refusing to accept, trying to control everything, rigid
- **Willingness:** Open to reality, doing what works, flexible

---

### Module 3: Emotion Regulation ⭐⭐⭐

**Purpose:** Understand emotions, reduce vulnerability to negative emotions, decrease emotional suffering, increase positive emotions.

**When to use:** Want to manage or change emotions BEFORE they become crisis-level.

---

#### Understanding Emotions

**What emotions do:**
1. **Communicate** to others (facial expressions, body language)
2. **Organize and motivate action** (fear → run, anger → fight, sadness → withdraw)
3. **Give information** about situations (internal signal system)

**Why emotions are hard in BPD:**
- Higher baseline emotional sensitivity
- React more intensely and quickly
- Take longer to return to baseline
- Biological vulnerability + invalidating environment = emotion dysregulation

---

#### Model for Describing Emotions

**Prompting Event** → **Interpretation** → **Body Changes + Expressions + Actions** → **Aftereffects**

**Example - Fear:**
1. **Prompting event:** [PARTNER] doesn't text back (external) + history of abandonment (internal)
2. **Interpretation:** "He's leaving me"
3. **Body changes:** Heart racing, sweating, tense muscles
4. **Expressions:** Worried face, shaky voice
5. **Actions:** Check phone repeatedly, text multiple times
6. **Aftereffects:** More anxiety, relationship strain

**Understanding this chain helps intervene at any point.**

---

#### ABC PLEASE (Reduce Vulnerability)

**Purpose:** Take care of your body so emotions aren't as intense or frequent. Build resilience.

**Accumulate positive emotions:**
- **Short-term:** Do one pleasant thing today
- **Long-term:** Build a life worth living (values, goals, meaning)

**Build mastery:**
- Do something that makes you feel competent
- Accomplish something daily
- Build confidence through achievement

**Cope ahead:**
- Imagine difficult situations ahead of time
- Rehearse using skills
- Practice coping in advance

**PLEASE (Physical health):**

**P - Physical illness**
- Treat illness promptly
- Take medications as prescribed
- See doctors when needed

**L - Eating**
- Regular balanced meals
- Not too much, not too little
- Avoid blood sugar crashes

**E - Avoid mood-altering substances**
- No alcohol or drugs
- Don't abuse prescriptions
- Stay clean

**A - Sleep**
- Regular sleep schedule
- 7-9 hours
- Sleep hygiene

**S - Exercise**
- Regular physical activity
- Even just walking counts
- Movement helps mood

**Why this matters:** When physically depleted, emotions are more intense and harder to manage. Taking care of body = more emotional resilience.

---

#### Check the Facts

**Purpose:** Determine if your emotion fits the facts of the situation.

**Questions to ask:**
1. What is the prompting event?
2. What are my interpretations, thoughts, assumptions?
3. Am I assuming a threat?
4. What's the catastrophe - worst case scenario?
5. Does my emotion and its intensity fit the ACTUAL facts?

**If emotion doesn't fit facts:**
- Practice opposite action (next skill)
- Emotion is valid BUT not helpful in this situation

**If emotion DOES fit facts:**
- Emotion is justified
- Use problem-solving, not opposite action

**Example:**
- **Event:** [PARTNER] cancels plans
- **Interpretation:** "He's abandoning me forever"
- **Check facts:** Has he actually said he's leaving? History shows he comes back. Canceling once ≠ abandonment
- **Conclusion:** Fear fits interpretation, NOT facts. Use opposite action.

---

#### Opposite Action ⭐⭐⭐

**Purpose:** When emotion doesn't fit the facts, OR when acting on emotion makes things worse, do the OPPOSITE of what emotion urges you to do.

**The principle:** Emotions come with action urges. Sometimes those urges make things worse. Acting opposite to the urge can change the emotion.

---

**Fear (when threat is not real or way out of proportion):**
- **Urge:** Avoid, escape, freeze
- **Opposite action:** Approach what you're afraid of, do it again and again
- **Body posture:** Stand up straight, confident posture

**Example:** Fear of being abandoned → urge to cling or push away → Opposite: Act as if relationship is secure, give space, trust

---

**Anger (when not justified or acting on it makes things worse):**
- **Urge:** Attack, argue, destroy, get revenge
- **Opposite action:** Gently avoid (take a break), be kind, empathize with other's perspective
- **Body posture:** Relax face and hands, gentle half-smile

**Example:** Angry at [PARTNER] for canceling → urge to rage-text → Opposite: Take space, empathize ("Maybe he's stressed"), be kind when you do talk

---

**Sadness/Depression (when unjustified or when withdrawal makes it worse):**
- **Urge:** Withdraw, isolate, stay in bed, avoid activities
- **Opposite action:** Get active, approach (don't avoid), engage with others, do things that make you feel competent
- **Body posture:** Upright, head up, energetic movement

**Example:** Depressed, want to stay in bed → Opposite: Get up, go for walk, call friend, accomplish one thing

---

**Shame (when unjustified or about something you want to change):**
- **Urge:** Hide, cover up, avoid, keep secret
- **Opposite action:** Share with safe person, expose what you feel ashamed of, be open
- **Body posture:** Make eye contact, head up

**Example:** Ashamed of crisis episode → urge to hide from [PARTNER] → Opposite: Tell [PARTNER] what happened, be vulnerable

---

**The paradox:** Acting opposite to emotion changes the emotion. You don't have to FEEL brave to act brave - acting brave reduces fear.

---

#### Problem Solving

**When to use:** When emotion DOES fit the facts and situation can be changed.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the problem
2. Check the facts
3. Identify your goal
4. Brainstorm solutions (many options)
5. Choose solution most likely to work
6. Try it
7. Evaluate - did it work?

**Example:**
- **Problem:** Can't afford therapy ($9,100/year for DBT)
- **Goal:** Get mental health support
- **Solutions:** AI assistant as DIY DBT coach, self-study, mood tracking systems
- **Choice:** Use SanctumTools with AI-assisted tracking
- **Result:** Learning DBT skills in real-time situations

---

### Module 4: Interpersonal Effectiveness ⭐⭐

---

#### FAST (Keeping self-respect)

**Use when:** You want to maintain your integrity and self-respect.

**F - Fair**

- ✅ FAST: "I need to talk to you about something. I know you're busy but this is important to me **(no excessive apologies, stick to values, fair, truthful)**"

---

#### Factors that Reduce Effectiveness

**Things that get in the way of interpersonal effectiveness:**

**Lack of skill:**
- Don't know how to ask
- Don't know what words to use
- Solution: Learn and practice DEAR MAN, GIVE, FAST

**Worry thoughts:**
- "They'll get mad"
- "I'll look stupid"
- "They'll say no"
- Solution: Check the facts, challenge thoughts

**Emotions:**
- Too much fear, anger, guilt
- Solution: Reduce vulnerability, opposite action

**Indecision:**
- Conflicting goals
- Don't know what you want
- Solution: Clarify priorities (objectives, relationship, self-respect)

**Environment:**
- Other person has power over you
- Timing is bad
- Solution: Consider context, pick your battles, cope ahead

## DBT for Bipolar Disorder: Evidence and Application

**2024 Research findings:**
- **Randomized trial:** DBT significantly reduced suicide attempts in adolescents with bipolar (more than standard care)
- **Systematic review:** DBT improves depressive symptoms, affective control, mindfulness in bipolar disorder
- **All studies:** DBT is feasible and acceptable for bipolar patients
- **Adaptations:** BI-REAL (12-session DBT skills group adapted for bipolar)

**Why DBT helps bipolar:**
- **Emotion regulation:** Addresses mood instability (core bipolar symptom)
- **Distress tolerance:** Gets through depressive or mixed episodes without self-harm
- **Interpersonal effectiveness:** Manages relationship strain caused by mood episodes
- **Crisis management:** Reduces suicide attempts (major risk in bipolar)

**Application for bipolar:**
- Use PLEASE to maintain routine (critical for mood stability)
- Opposite action for depression (get active vs. withdraw)
- Distress tolerance during mixed states (when can't solve, just survive)
- Interpersonal skills to repair relationships after episodes

---

## DBT for BPD: The Gold Standard

**Evidence:**
- First therapy experimentally proven effective for BPD
- Reduces self-harm and suicidal behavior
- Improves emotional regulation
- Decreases hospitalization
- Improves quality of life

**Why DBT was created for BPD:**
- BPD = emotional dysregulation disorder
- Chronic suicidality needed new approach
- Standard CBT wasn't enough - needed acceptance + change dialectic
- Invalidating environments + biological vulnerability = BPD
- DBT provides validation (you make sense) + skills (you can change)

**Core BPD targets DBT addresses:**
1. **Life-threatening behaviors:** Suicidality, self-harm
2. **Therapy-interfering behaviors:** Missing sessions, non-compliance
3. **Quality-of-life interfering:** Anything that makes life unbearable

---

## Integration with Other Modalities in SanctumTools

**DBT's role in multi-modal approach:**

**Use DBT when:**
- **Crisis level** (8-10/10) - STOP, TIPP, distress tolerance
- **Active suicidal ideation** - crisis survival skills
- **Extreme emotion before solving problem** - emotion regulation skills
- **Self-harm urges** - distress tolerance, opposite action
- **Relationship conflict needing concrete skills** - DEAR MAN

**Use other modalities when:**
- **CBT:** Post-crisis cognitive work (challenge thoughts)
- **MBT:** Relationship mentalizing (understand minds)
- **Schema:** Mode work (fight Punitive Parent, soothe Vulnerable Child)
- **MBSR:** Grounding in present moment (mindfulness foundation)
- **ACT:** Acceptance when reality can't change

**The flow:**
```
High arousal (8-10/10) → DBT Distress Tolerance (survive crisis)

## Notes for [AI]: DBT Already Integrated in CLAUDE.md

**DBT protocols already documented in CLAUDE.md:**
- DBT Diary Card conversational tracking (end of day)
- DBT skills coaching during mood shifts
- Crisis protocols referencing distress tolerance
- STOP protocol mentioned

**What this document adds:**
- Complete framework of all 4 modules
- Detailed skill breakdowns
- Evidence base and research
- Integration logic with other modalities

**[AI]'s role with DBT:**
- Recognize when arousal level requires DBT (8-10/10)
- Coach on which skill to use in moment
- Use diary card data to identify patterns
- Teach skills conversationally as crises arise

**Testing:** Already ongoing - [USER] uses DBT skills, tracks with diary card.
