## Overview

These 5 CBT skills appeared across ALL credible sources reviewed. This cross-validation confirms they are the foundational techniques of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

**Core CBT Premise:** Events don't directly cause emotions. Our THOUGHTS about events cause our emotional responses. Change the thoughts → change the feelings.

---

## Skill 1: Thoughts → Feelings Connection

**What it is:**
Understanding that external events don't directly cause emotions - our interpretation and thoughts about those events determine how we feel.

**The Model:**
```
Event → Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors
(NOT: Event → Feelings directly)
```

**Example:**
- **Event:** Partner comes home, says "hi" but no kiss
- **Thought A:** "She's tired of me being depressed. She doesn't love me anymore." → **Feeling:** Sad, anxious
- **Thought B:** "She must have had a rough day at work." → **Feeling:** Concerned but calm
- **Thought C:** "She's probably rushing to put groceries away." → **Feeling:** Neutral

Same event, three different thoughts, three different emotional outcomes.

**When to use:**
- When someone says "X made me feel Y" (identifying the thought step they're skipping)
- When emotions seem confusing or disproportionate to situation
- Foundation for all other CBT skills

**Conversational approach:**
- "What were you thinking when that happened?"
- "What was going through your mind right before you felt [emotion]?"
- "Let's slow that down - the event was [X], and you felt [Y]. What thought connected those two?"

## Skill 2: Identifying Cognitive Distortions

**What it is:**
Recognizing common thinking errors (cognitive distortions) that make situations seem worse than they are and intensify negative emotions.

**The 10 Core Distortions (validated across all sources):**

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black & White):** Viewing things in absolute terms - perfect or total failure, no middle ground
   - Example: "I made one mistake in the presentation, so the whole thing was a disaster."

2. **Overgeneralization:** One negative event becomes a never-ending pattern of defeat
   - Example: "I got rejected once, so I'll ALWAYS be rejected."

3. **Mental Filter (Negative Filter):** Focusing exclusively on negatives, ignoring or discounting positives
   - Example: Got 9 compliments and 1 criticism, only think about the criticism

4. **Jumping to Conclusions:**
   - **Mind Reading:** Assuming you know what others are thinking (negative) without evidence
   - **Fortune Telling:** Predicting things will turn out badly without evidence

5. **Emotional Reasoning:** "I feel it, therefore it must be true"
   - Example: "I feel like a failure, therefore I AM a failure."

6. **Should Statements (Musts/Oughts):** Rigid demands on self or others using "should," "must," "have to"
   - Example: "I should never make mistakes." "They must approve of me."

7. **Labeling:** Attaching global negative labels to self or others based on single events
   - Example: "I'm a loser" instead of "I made a mistake"

8. **Personalization/Blame:**
   - Taking personal responsibility for things outside your control
   - OR blaming others entirely, overlooking your contribution

9. **Magnification/Catastrophizing:** Blowing things way out of proportion
   - Example: "If I fail this test, my entire life is ruined."

10. **Disqualifying the Positive:** Rejecting positive experiences by insisting they "don't count"
    - Example: "They only said that to be nice, they didn't mean it."

**When to use:**
- After identifying the thoughts (Skill 1) - analyze what TYPE of thinking error is happening
- When thoughts seem extreme, rigid, or catastrophic
- Before challenging thoughts (helps identify what specific error to address)

**Conversational approach:**
- "That thought sounds like [distortion name] - where you're [explain what's happening]"
- "I notice you're using words like 'always' and 'never' - that's often all-or-nothing thinking"
- "You're predicting the future there - how sure are you that's what will happen?"
- "It sounds like you're reading their mind - what actual evidence do you have for that?"

## Skill 3: Behavioral Activation

**What it is:**
Breaking the depression → inactivity → worse depression cycle by deliberately increasing activity levels, especially pleasurable activities and achievement-oriented tasks.

**The Depression Cycle:**
```
Depression → Low motivation → Decreased activity →
Miss positive experiences → Feel worse → Even less motivation
```

**Breaking the Cycle:**
```
Choose small activity → DO it (regardless of motivation) →
Experience pleasure/achievement → Feel slightly better → More motivation
```

**Core Principle:** **"Action is the first step, not motivation."**
You don't wait to feel motivated - you act first, and motivation follows.

**Two Activity Types:**

1. **FUN/PLEASURE Activities:** Things that bring enjoyment, relaxation, positive feelings
   - Examples: Listen to music, take a bath, watch favorite show, pet the dog, eat comfort food

2. **ACHIEVEMENT/MASTERY Activities:** Tasks that give sense of accomplishment, control, purpose
   - Examples: Make bed, do dishes, pay one bill, take shower, respond to one email

**Start Simple - Break It Down:**
- Don't try to clean the whole house → just clear one counter
- Don't try to read a book → read for 5 minutes
- Don't try to exercise → walk to the mailbox
- Don't try to shower and get dressed → just get out of bed for 10 minutes

**Rate Before & After:**
- Before activity: Rate depression/mood 0-10
- After activity: Rate depression/mood 0-10
- Track if activity helped (even slightly)

**When to use:**
- When stuck in depressive inactivity cycle
- When "I don't feel like doing anything" comes up
- When motivation is completely absent
- Post-dysregulation recovery (gentle re-engagement)

**Conversational approach:**
- "What's ONE small thing you could do right now? Not a big thing, the smallest possible version."
- "You don't have to want to do it - let's just pick something tiny and see what happens after."
- "Let's rate your mood now, then you do [small activity], then we'll rate again and see if it shifted even 1 point."
- "Remember: action first, motivation follows. Not the other way around."
- "What would count as a win right now? Can we make it even smaller than that?"

## Skill 4: Thought Records (ABC → ABCD)

**What it is:**
Structured method for capturing and analyzing the connection between events, thoughts, and emotions - then challenging those thoughts.

**The ABCD Model:**

**A = Activating Event**
What happened? (External event, internal trigger, memory, physical sensation)
- Be specific and objective
- Stick to facts, not interpretations

**B = Beliefs (Thoughts)**
What thoughts went through your mind about the event?
- List ALL thoughts
- Identify the "HOT THOUGHT" (most distressing, mark with *)
- Rate how much you believe it (0-100)

**C = Consequences**
Emotional and physical consequences:
- Emotions felt (sad, angry, anxious, etc.)
- Rate intensity of strongest emotion (0-100)
- Physical sensations (racing heart, tension, exhaustion)
- Behaviors (what you did or didn't do)

**D = Detective Work & Disputation**
Challenge the hot thought:
- Evidence FOR the thought
- Evidence AGAINST the thought
- Alternative explanations
- Different perspectives
- Balanced thought to replace distorted one

**When to use:**
- When emotions are intense and confusing
- When stuck in a thought loop
- After a difficult situation to process it
- To identify patterns over time (weekly review)

**Conversational approach:**
- Do this AS A CONVERSATION, not as a form to fill out
- "Okay, let's slow this down. What actually happened? Just the facts."
- "What were you thinking when that happened? What was the thought that felt the worst?"
- "On a scale of 0 to 100, how much do you believe that thought right now?"
- "How did you feel? And how intense was it, 0 to 100?"
- "Now let's be detectives. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?"
- "What evidence goes against it? What doesn't fit?"
- "If your best friend had this thought, what would you tell them?"
- "What's another way to look at this situation?"

## Skill 5: Thought Challenging (Detective Work & Disputation)

**What it is:**
Questioning the validity and helpfulness of negative automatic thoughts by gathering evidence and considering alternative perspectives - like being a detective and a lawyer.

**Core Questions - Detective Work (Gathering Evidence):**

1. **"What is the evidence for this thought?"**
   - What facts support it?
   - What PROOF do I have?

2. **"What is the evidence against this thought?"**
   - What facts contradict it?
   - What am I overlooking or ignoring?

3. **"How do I KNOW this thought is true?"**
   - Am I jumping to conclusions?
   - Am I reading minds or predicting the future?

**Core Questions - Disputation (Alternative Perspectives):**

4. **"What are other ways of viewing this situation?"**
   - What else could explain what happened?

5. **"How might someone else view this?"**
   - What would a friend say about this situation?

6. **"If I weren't feeling [depressed/anxious/angry], how might I see this differently?"**
   - How would I view this on a good day?

7. **"What would I tell a friend who had this thought?"**
   - Would I be this harsh with someone I care about?

8. **"How likely is this outcome REALISTICALLY?"**
   - Am I catastrophizing?
   - What's the actual probability?

9. **"Is thinking this way HELPFUL to me?"**
   - Does this thought help me solve the problem?
   - Does it help me feel better or function better?

**The Goal:**
Not "positive thinking" - it's BALANCED, REALISTIC thinking. Replace distorted thoughts with more accurate, fair, helpful thoughts.

**Example:**

**Hot Thought:** "I'm a complete failure. I can't do anything right." (Belief: 90/100)

**Detective Work:**
- Evidence FOR: I made mistakes on this project. I didn't meet the deadline.
- Evidence AGAINST: I've successfully completed 15 other projects this year. My boss gave me positive feedback last month. I met most of the deliverables, just missed one deadline due to illness.

**Disputation:**
- Alternative view: I'm struggling with THIS project, not failing at everything.
- What would I tell a friend?: "You hit a rough patch, but that doesn't erase all your successes."
- Realistic assessment: Missing one deadline doesn't make me a complete failure - it makes me human.

**Balanced Thought:** "I'm disappointed I missed the deadline, but this one mistake doesn't define my entire work performance. I've been successful many times before." (Belief in original thought: 30/100)

**When to use:**
- After identifying distorted thoughts (use with Skill 2)
- When automatic thoughts are intense and believable
- When stuck ruminating on negative thoughts
- During/after dysregulation to process what happened

**Conversational approach:**
- "Let's put that thought on trial. What evidence do you have that it's true?"
- "Okay, now let's look at evidence that contradicts it. What doesn't fit with that thought?"
- "What if your best friend said this about themselves - what would you tell them?"
- "How would you view this situation if you weren't feeling [emotion] right now?"
- "Is thinking this way helping you, or is it making things harder?"
- "That thought feels 90% true right now. After looking at the evidence, what does it feel like now?"

## Integration with Existing SanctumTools Skills

**CBT complements (doesn't replace):**
- **ACT:** When thoughts can't be changed, use acceptance/defusion
- **DBT:** When emotions are overwhelming, use distress tolerance first, THEN CBT
- **Mindfulness:** Observe thoughts before challenging them

**When to use CBT vs other modalities:**
- **Use CBT when:** Thoughts are distorted and changeable, person has cognitive capacity
- **Use ACT when:** Thoughts are unchangeable facts, person is stuck fighting reality
- **Use DBT when:** Emotions are crisis-level, person needs stabilization first
- **Use Mindfulness when:** Person is ruminating, needs present-moment grounding

## Notes for AI Implementation

**How to teach these conversationally:**

1. **Don't say "Let's fill out a thought record"** - that triggers form anxiety
2. **DO say "Let's slow this down and look at what happened"** - conversational framing
3. **Ask questions, don't lecture** - Socratic method (CBT's core teaching style)
4. **Use real situations from mood tracking** - teach in context when actually needed
5. **Name the skill after using it** - "What we just did is called thought challenging in CBT"
6. **Track effectiveness** - "Did that help? Rate your belief in that thought now vs before."

**AI learning process:**
- Test these conversationally during mood tracking
- Document what works/doesn't work
- Refine conversational scripts based on user responses
- Continuously improve based on feedback
