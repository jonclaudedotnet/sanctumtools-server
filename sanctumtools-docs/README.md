# SanctumTools - Mental Health Tracking + DIY Therapy

**🔬 BETA TESTING - Your Feedback Wanted**

A comprehensive mental health tracking system with integrated therapeutic frameworks (DBT, CBT, Schema Therapy, MBSR) designed for anyone managing mood disorders, emotional dysregulation, or mental health conditions.

**Perfect for:** Bipolar disorder (all types), BPD, depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, or any condition where tracking patterns helps treatment.

**What's New:** AI-assisted DIY therapy protocols - professional therapy skills without the $9,100/year price tag.

## Who This Is For

**Anyone tracking mental health patterns:**
- Bipolar disorder (rapid cycling, ultradian, standard)
- Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
- Depression and anxiety
- ADHD with emotional dysregulation
- PTSD and trauma responses
- Any condition where mood/emotional tracking helps treatment

**Originally designed for ultra-rapid cycling (multiple mood states per day):**
- Captures exact timestamps of emotional shifts
- Tracks triggers, physical symptoms, functionality
- Documents patterns for psychiatrists and disability claims
- Works for anyone from 1 mood shift per week to 10+ per day

**Why timestamped precision matters:**
- Medication response tracking
- Trigger identification
- Pattern recognition over time
- Evidence for treatment adjustments
- Disability documentation (SSDI claims)

## Why This System Exists

Traditional mood tracking apps don't capture what you actually need:

1. **Timestamped precision** - Exact times of emotional shifts, not daily averages
2. **Trigger identification** - What caused each shift? What patterns emerge?
3. **Context capture** - Physical symptoms, functionality level, what you were doing
4. **Treatment evidence** - Data for psychiatrists to adjust medications effectively
5. **Disability documentation** - Proof of severity for SSDI/disability claims
6. **Safety planning** - Recognize dangerous patterns before crisis hits
7. **Therapeutic skill building** - Learn DBT, CBT, Schema Therapy, MBSR with AI coaching

This system provides psychiatric-grade documentation that helps you explain your experience to doctors, therapists, employers, and disability reviewers - with professional therapy skills built in.

## What This System Tracks

### Primary Metrics:
- **Timestamp** - Exact time of mood shift
- **Previous mood state** - What you were feeling before
- **Current mood state** - What you're feeling now
- **Trigger** - What caused the shift (or "spontaneous")
- **Physical symptoms** - Body sensations during the shift
- **Functionality level** - Can you work/function in this state?
- **Duration** - How long each state lasts

### Additional Recommended Metrics:
- Sleep quality, duration, timing
- Medication adherence (times taken, doses)
- Substance use (cannabis, alcohol, etc.)
- Food intake and cravings
- Pain levels (for comorbid conditions like fibromyalgia)
- Stressors throughout the day
- Impact on functioning (1-10 scale)

## How to Use This System

### 1. Daily Baseline (Morning)
Start each day by establishing your baseline:
- Time you woke up
- Sleep duration and quality
- How you got out of bed (easy, struggled, energized, depressed, etc.)
- Current mood state at day start
- Morning medication times

### 2. Real-Time Mood Shift Logging
When you notice a mood shift, immediately log:
- Current time
- What mood state you just left
- What mood state you're entering
- What triggered it (if known)
- Physical symptoms
- What you're doing/able to do

### 3. End of Day Summary
- Final mood state before bed
- Total number of distinct states for the day
- Average duration per state
- Major triggers identified
- Interventions that worked/didn't work

### 4. Weekly Pattern Analysis
- Review the week's data
- Identify recurring triggers
- Note time patterns (worse in morning/evening?)
- Share with psychiatrist/therapist

## What's in This System

### Getting Started:

**`user_intake_form.md`** - AI's knowledge database guide—your AI learns about you conversationally, no forms to fill out

### Core Tracking Templates:

**Root-level templates:**

**For Psychiatrists:**
- Objective evidence of cycling frequency and severity
- Trigger identification for targeted interventions
- Medication response tracking
- Safety planning data

**For SSDI/Disability:**
- Proof of inability to maintain consistent function
- Documentation of crisis frequency during work hours
- Evidence that productivity is "unsustainable" not "absent"
- Timeline showing unpredictability incompatible with employment

**For Therapists:**
- DBT skill application tracking
- Crisis intervention effectiveness
- Pattern recognition for prevention
- Conversational DBT diary card alternative (for clients with form anxiety)

**For You:**
- Self-awareness of patterns
- Early warning signs recognition
- Evidence that you're not "making this up"
- Validation that your experience is real and severe

## Important Notes

### This is NOT a replacement for professional treatment
This tracking system is a **tool** to support psychiatric care, not replace it. You still need:
- A psychiatrist for medication management
- A therapist (DBT highly recommended for rapid cycling)
- Crisis support contacts
- Emergency plan for suicidal ideation

### Privacy and Safety
- Store this data securely
- Consider who has access (therapist, psychiatrist, trusted support person)
- Back up regularly (you don't want to lose this documentation)
- Use encryption if storing digitally

### When to Seek Immediate Help
If you experience:
- Suicidal ideation with plan/intent
- Self-harm behaviors
- Psychotic symptoms
- Inability to function for 24+ hours

**Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to nearest ER**
